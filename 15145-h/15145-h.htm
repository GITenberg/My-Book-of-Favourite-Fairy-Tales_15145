    <h2>THE OLD, OLD STORIES</h2>

    <p>Here they are again, the old, old stories, the very best;
    dear Cinderella, wicked old Bluebeard, tiny Thumbling,
    beautiful Beauty and the ugly Beast, and a host of others. But
    the old stories, I may tell you, are always new, and always
    must be so, because there are new children to read them every
    day, and to these, of course, these old tales might have been
    written yesterday.</p>

    <p>But the stories in this book are new in another way. Look
    how they are clothed, look at their beautiful setting, the
    wonderful <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"
       id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span> pictures! Have you ever seen
       such charming princes and lovely princesses, such dainty
       grace and delicate feeling?</p>

    <p>What would our grandfathers and grandmothers have said of
    such a book! They would have thought there was magic in the
    brush and pencil.</p>

    <p>Surely we are favoured in this generation when we see before
    us, the old, old fairy tales, which are ever new, dressed in
    such a beautiful and splendid fashion!</p>

    <h2>THE GOOSE GIRL</h2>

    <p>An old queen, whose husband had been dead some years, had a
    beautiful daughter. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a
    prince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for
    her to be married, she got ready to set off on her journey to
    his country. Then the queen, her mother, packed up a great many
    costly things&mdash;jewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets,
    fine dresses, and, in short, everything that became a royal
    bride; for she loved her child very dearly: and she gave her a
    waiting-maid to ride with her, and give
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> her into the bridegroom's
       hands; and each had a horse for the journey. Now the
       princess's horse was called Falada, and could speak.</p>

    <p>When the time came for them to set out, the old queen went
    into her bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a
    lock of her hair, and gave it to her daughter, and said, "Take
    care of it, dear child; for it is a charm that may be of use to
    you on the road." Then they took a sorrowful leave of each
    other, and the princess put the lock of her mother's hair into
    her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to
    her bridegroom's kingdom. One day, as they were riding along by
    the side of a brook, the princess began to feel very thirsty,
    and said to her maid, "Pray get down and fetch me some water,
    in my golden cup, out of yonder brook, for I want to drink."
    "Nay," said the maid, "if you are thirsty, get down yourself,
    and lie down by the water and drink; I shall not be your
    waiting-maid any longer." Then the princess was so thirsty that
    she got down, and knelt over the brook and drank, for she was
    frightened, and dared not bring out her golden cup; and then
    she wept, and said "Alas! what will become of me?" And the lock
    of hair answered her, and said&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</p>

            <p>Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But the princess was very humble and meek, so she said
    nothing to her maid's ill behaviour, but got upon her horse
    again.</p>

    <p>Then all rode further on their journey, till the day grew so
    warm, and the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel
    very thirsty again; and at last, when they came to a river, she
    forgot her maid's rude speech, and said, "Pray get down and
    fetch me some water to drink in my golden cup." But the maid
    answered her, and even spoke more haughtily than before,
    "Drink, if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid."
    Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse and
    lay down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried,
    and said, "What will become of me?" And the lock of hair
    answered her again&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</p>

            <p>Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it."</p>
        </div>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>

    <p>And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from
    her bosom and floated away with the water, without her seeing
    it, she was so frightened. But her maid saw it, and was very
    glad, for she knew the charm, and saw that the poor bride would
    be in her power now that she had lost the hair. So when the
    bride had drunk, and would have got upon Falada again, the maid
    said, "I shall ride upon Falada and you may have my horse
    instead;" so she was forced to give up her horse, and soon
    afterwards to take off her royal clothes, and put on her maid's
    shabby ones.</p>

    <p>At last, as they drew near the end of the journey, this
    treacherous servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever
    told anyone what had happened. But Falada saw it all, and
    marked it well. Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the
    real bride was set upon the other horse, and they went on in
    this way till at last they came to the royal court. There was
    great joy at their coming, the prince hurried to meet them, and
    lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one who
    was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal
    chamber, but the true princess was told to stay in the court
    below.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:60%;">
        <img width="400"
             src="images/011.png"
             alt="Kneeling girl" />
    </div>

    <p>But the old king happened to be looking out of the window,
    and saw her in the yard below; and as she looked very pretty,
    and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went into the royal
    chamber to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her,
    that was thus left standing in the court below. "I brought her
    with me for the sake of her company on the road," said she.
    "Pray give the girl some work to do, that she may not be idle."
    The old king could not for some
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span> time think of any work for
       her to do, but at last he said, "I have a lad who takes care
       of my geese; she may go and help him." Now the name of this
       lad, that the real bride was to help in watching the king's
       geese, was Curdken.</p>

    <p>Soon after, the false bride said to the prince, "Dear
    husband pray do me one piece of kindness." "That I will," said
    the prince. "Then tell one of your slaughterers to cut off the
    head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very unruly, and
    plagued me sadly on the road." But the truth was, she was very
    much afraid lest Falada should speak, and tell all she had done
    to the princess. She carried her point, and the faithful Falada
    was killed; but when the true princess heard of it she wept,
    and begged the man to nail up Falada's head against a large
    dark gate in the city through which she had to pass every
    morning and evening, that there she might still see him
    sometimes. Then the slaughterer said he would do as she wished;
    cut off the head, and nailed it fast under the dark gate.</p>

    <p>Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through
    the gate, she said sorrowfully&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Falada, Falada, there thou art hanging!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and the head answered&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Bride, bride, there thou art ganging!</p>

            <p>Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</p>

            <p>Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese in. And
    when she came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank here, and
    let down her waving locks of hair, which were all of pure gold;
    and when Curdken saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and
    would have pulled some of the locks out; but she
    cried&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Blow, breezes, blow!</p>

    <p>Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken's
    hat, and away it flew over the hills, and he after it; till, by
    the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her
    hair, and put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and
    sulky, and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the
    geese until it grew dark in the evening, and then drove them
    homewards.</p>

    <p>The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate,
    the poor girl looked up at Falada's head, and cried&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Falada, Falada, there thou art hanging!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and it answered&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Bride, bride, there thou art ganging!</p>

            <p>Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</p>

            <p>Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Then she drove on the geese and sat down again in the
    meadow, and began to comb out her hair as before, and Curdken
    ran up to her, and wanted to take hold of it; but she cried out
    quickly&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Blow, breezes, blow!</p>

            <p>Let Curdken's hat go,</p>

            <p>Blow, breezes, blow!</p>

            <p>Let him after it go!</p>

            <p>O'er hills, dales, and rocks,</p>

            <p>Away be it whirl'd,</p>

            <p>Till the golden locks</p>

            <p>Are all comb'd and curl'd!"</p>
        </div>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>

    <p>Then the wind came and blew his hat, and off it flew a great
    way, over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after
    it; and when he came back, she had done up her hair again, and
    all was safe. So they watched the geese till it grew dark.</p>

    <p>In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the
    old king, and said, "I cannot have that strange girl to help me
    to keep the geese any longer."</p>

    <p>"Why?" said the king.</p>

    <p>"Because she does nothing but tease me all day long."</p>

    <p>Then the king made him tell all that had passed.</p>

    <p>And Curdken said, "When we go in the morning through the
    dark gate with our flock of geese, she weeps, and talks with
    the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and
    says&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"'Falada, Falada, there thou art hanging!'"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and the head answers&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"'Bride, bride, there thou art ganging!</p>

            <p>Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</p>

            <p>Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it.'"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon
    the meadow where the geese fed; and how his hat was blown away,
    and he was forced to run after it, and leave his flock. But the
    old king told him to go out again as usual the next day, and
    when morning came, the king placed himself behind the gate, and
    heard how she spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered; and
    then he went into the field and hid himself in a bush by the
    meadow's side, and soon saw with his own eyes how they drove
    the flock of geese, and how, after a little time, she let down
    her hair that glittered in the sun; and then he heard her
    say&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">

    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>

    <p>And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken's
    hat, while the girl went on combing and curling her hair.</p>

    <p>All this the old king saw: so he went home without being
    seen; and when the little goose girl came back in the evening,
    he called her aside, and asked her why she did so: but she
    burst into tears, and said, "That I must not tell you or any
    man, or I shall lose my life."</p>

    <p>But the old king begged so hard that she had no peace till
    she had told him all, word for word: and it was very lucky for
    her that she did so, for the king ordered royal clothes to be
    put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was so
    beautiful.</p>

    <p>Then he called his son, and told him that he had only the
    false bride, for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the
    true one stood by.</p>

    <p>And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and
    heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying
    anything, ordered a great feast to be got ready for all his
    court.</p>

    <p>The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on
    one side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her,
    for she was quite dazzling to their eyes, and was not at all
    like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant
    dress.</p>

    <p>When they had eaten and drunk, and were very merry, the old
    king told all the story, as one that he had once heard of, and
    asked the true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done
    to anyone who would behave thus.</p>

    <p>"Nothing better," said this false bride, "than that she
    should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and
    that two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it
    from street to street till she is dead."</p>

    <p>"Thou art she!" said the old king; "and since thou hast
    judged thyself, it shall be so done to thee."</p>

    <p>And the young king was married to his true wife, and they
    reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness all their
    lives.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"

    <h2>LITTLE SNOW-WHITE</h2>

    <p>It was in the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of
    snow were falling around, that a certain queen sat working at
    the window, the frame of which was made of fine black ebony;
    and as she was looking out upon the snow, she pricked her
    finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed
    thoughtfully upon the red drops which sprinkled the white snow,
    and said, "Would that my little daughter may be as white as
    that snow, as red as the blood, and as black as the ebony
    window-frame!" And so the little girl grew up: her skin was as
    white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as blood, and her hair as
    black as ebony; and she was called Snow-White.</p>

    <p>But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife,
    who was very beautiful, but so proud that she could not bear to
    think that any one could surpass her. She had a magical
    looking-glass, to which she used to go and gaze upon herself in
    it, and say,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Tell me, glass, tell me true!</p>

            <p>Of all the ladies in the land.</p>

            <p>Who is fairest? Tell me who?"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And the glass answered, "Thou, Queen, art fairest in the
    land."</p>

    <p>But Snow-White grew more and more beautiful; and when she
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span> was seven years old, she was
       as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.
       Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to
       consult it as usual:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Thou, Queen, may'st fair and beauteous be,</p>

            <p>But Snow-White is lovelier far than thee!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy; and
    calling to one of her servants said, "Take Snow-White away into
    the wide wood, that I may never see her more." Then the servant
    led her away; but his heart melted when she begged him to spare
    her life, and he said, "I will not hurt thee, thou pretty
    child." So he left her by herself, and though he thought it
    most likely that the wild beasts would tear her to pieces, he
    felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had
    made up his mind not to kill her, but leave her to her
    fate.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:50%;">
        <img width="300"
             src="images/018.png"
             alt="Snow-White with Servant" />
    </div>

    <p>Then poor Snow-White wandered along through the wood in
    great fear; and the wild beasts roared about her, but none did
    her any harm. In the evening she came to a little cottage, and
    went in there to rest herself, for her weary feet would carry
    her no further. Everything was spruce and neat in the cottage:
    on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven
    little plates with seven little loaves and seven little glasses
    with wine in them; and knives and forks laid in order, and by
    the wall stood seven little beds. Then, as she was very hungry,
    she picked a little piece off each loaf, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> drank a very little wine out
       of each glass; and after that she thought she would lie down
       and rest. So she tried all the little beds; and one was too
       long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh
       suited her; and there she laid herself down and went to
       sleep. Presently in came the masters of the cottage, who
       were seven little dwarfs that lived among the mountains, and
       dug and searched about for gold. They lighted up their seven
       lamps, and saw directly that all was not right. The first
       said, "Who has been sitting on my stool?" The second, "Who
       has been eating off my plate?" The third, "Who has been
       picking at my bread?" the fourth, "Who has been meddling
       with my spoon?" The fifth, "Who has been handling my fork?"
       The sixth, "Who has been cutting with my knife?" The
       seventh, "Who has been drinking my wine?" Then the first
       looked round and said. "Who has been lying on my bed?" And
       the rest came running to him, and every one cried out that
       somebody had been upon his bed. But the seventh saw
       Snow-White, and called upon his brethren to come and see
       her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment, and
       brought their lamps to look at her, and said, "Good heavens!
       What a lovely child she is!" and they were delighted to see
       her, and took care not to waken her; and the seventh dwarf
       slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till
       the night was gone.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/158.jpg"

        MIRROR&mdash;"LITTLE SNOW-WHITE"
    </div>

    <p>In the morning Snow-White told them all her story; and they
    pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order, and
    cook and wash, and knit and spin for them, she might stay where
    she was, and they would take good care of her. Then they went
    out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in
    the mountains; and Snow-White remained at home: and they warned
    her, and said, "The queen will soon find out where you are, so
    take care and let no one in." But the queen, now that she
    thought Snow-White was dead, believed that she was certainly
    the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass, and
    the glass answered,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Thou, Queen, thou art fairest in all this land;</p>

            <p>But over the hills, in the greenwood shade.</p>

            <p>Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made.</p>

            <p>There Snow-White is hiding her head; and she</p>

            <p>Is lovelier far, O Queen, than thee."</p>
        </div>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>

    <p>Then the queen was very much alarmed; for she knew that the
    glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had
    betrayed her. And she could not bear to think that anyone lived
    who was more beautiful than she was; so she disguised herself
    as a pedlar and went her way over the hills to the place where
    the dwarfs dwelt. Then she knocked at the door, and cried,
    "Fine wares to sell!" Snow-White looked out of the window, and
    cried, "Good-day, good woman; what have you to sell?" "Good
    wares, fine wares," said she; "laces and bobbins of all
    colours." "I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very
    good sort of a body," thought Snow-White; so she ran down, and
    unbolted the door. "Bless me!" said the woman, "how badly your
    stays are laced. Let me lace them up with one of my nice new
    laces." Snow-White did not dream of any mischief; so she stood
    up before the old woman; but she set to work so nimbly, and
    pulled the lace so tight, that Snow-White lost her breath, and
    fell down as if she were dead. "There's an end of all thy
    beauty," said the spiteful queen, and went away home.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <img width="449"
             src="images/020.png"

        <br />
         "'THERE'S AN END TO ALL THY BEAUTY' SAID THE SPITEFUL
        QUEEN,<br />
         AND SHE WENT AWAY HOME."
    </div>

    <p>In the evening the seven dwarfs returned; and I need not say
    how grieved they were to see their faithful Snow-White
    stretched upon the ground motionless, as if she were quite
    dead. However, they lifted her up, and when they found what was
    the matter, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began
    to breathe, and soon came to life again. Then they said, "The
    old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and
    let no one in when we are away."</p>

    <p>When the queen got home, she went to her glass, and spoke to
    it, but to her surprise it said the same words as before.</p>

    <p>Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice
    to see that Snow-White still lived; and she dressed herself up
    again in a disguise, but very different from the one she wore
    before, and took with her a poisoned comb, When she reached the
    dwarf's cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, "Fine
    wares to sell!" but Snow-White said, "I dare not let anyone
    in." Then the queen begged, "Only look at my beautiful combs;"
    and gave her the poisoned <!--page 21 had illustration-->
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> one. And it looked so pretty
       that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but
       the moment it touched her head the poison was so powerful
       that she fell down senseless.</p>

    <p>"There you may lie," said the queen, and went her way. But
    by good luck the dwarfs returned very early that evening; and
    when they saw Snow-White lying on the ground, they thought what
    had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when they
    took it away, she recovered, and told them all that had passed;
    and they warned her once more not to open the door to
    anyone.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <img width="500"
             src="images/022.png"
             alt=" The Queen and senseless Snow-White" />
    </div>

    <p>Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and trembled with
    rage when she received exactly the same answer as before; and
    she said "Snow-White shall die, if it costs me my life." So she
    went secretly into a chamber, and prepared a poisoned apple;
    the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whosoever tasted
    it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a peasant's
    wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs' cottage, and
    knocked at the door; but Snow-White put her head out of the
    window, and said, "I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs
    have told me not to." "Do as you please," said the old woman,
    "but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will make you a
    present of it." "No," said Snow-White, "I dare not take it."
    "You silly girl!" answered the other, "what are you afraid of?
    Do you think it <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> is poisoned? Come! do you eat
       one part, and I will eat the other." Now the apple was so
       prepared that one side was good, though the other side was
       poisoned. Then Snow-White was very much tempted to taste,
       for the apple looked exceedingly nice; and when she saw the
       old woman eat, she could refrain no longer. But she had
       scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down
       dead upon the ground. "This time nothing will save thee,"
       said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last
       it said,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Thou, Queen, art the fairest of all the fair."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And then her envious heart was glad, and as happy as such a
    heart could be.</p>

    <p>When evening came, and the dwarfs returned home, they found
    Snow-White lying on the ground; no breath passed her lips, and
    they were afraid that she was quite dead. They lifted her up,
    and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water;
    but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead. So
    they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and
    bewailed her three whole days; and then they proposed to bury
    her; but her cheeks were still rosy, and her face looked just
    as it did while she was alive; so they said, "We will never
    bury her in the cold ground." And they made a coffin of glass
    so that they might still look at her, and wrote her name upon
    it in golden letters, and that she was a king's daughter. And
    the coffin was placed upon the hill, and one of the dwarfs
    always sat by it and watched. And the birds of the air came
    too, and bemoaned Snow-White. First of all came an owl, and
    then a raven, but at last came a dove.</p>

    <p>And thus Snow-White lay for a long, long time, and still
    only looked as though she were asleep; for she was even now as
    white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At
    last a prince came and called at the dwarfs' house; and he saw
    Snow-White, and read what was written in gold letters. Then he
    offered the dwarfs money, and earnestly prayed them to let him
    take her away; but they said, "We will not part with her for
    all the gold in the world." At last, however, they had pity on
    him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to
    carry it home with him, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> the piece of apple fell from
       between her lips, and Snow-White awoke, and said, "Where am
       I?" And the prince answered, "Thou art safe with me." Then
       he told her all that had happened, and said, "I love you
       better than all the world; come with me to my father's
       palace, and you shall be my wife." And Snow-White consented,
       and went home with the prince; and everything was prepared
       with great pomp and splendour for their wedding.</p>

    <p>To the feast was invited, among the rest, Snow-White's old
    enemy, the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine, rich
    clothes, she looked, in the glass, and the glass answered,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Thou, lady, art the loveliest <i>here</i>, I
            ween;</p>

            <p>But lovelier far is the new-made queen."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>When she heard this, she started with rage; but her envy and
    curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to
    see the bride. And when she arrived, and saw that it was none
    other than Snow-White, who she thought had been dead a long
    while, she choked with passion, and fell ill and died; but
    Snow-White and the prince lived and reigned happily over that
    land many, many years.</p>

    <h2>CINDERELLA</h2>

    <p>The wife of a rich man fell sick: and when she felt that her
    end drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bedside, and
    said, "Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven
    and watch over you." Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and
    died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went
    every day to her grave and wept, and was always good and kind
    to all about her. And the snow spread a beautiful white
    covering over the grave: but by the time the sun had melted it
    away again, her father had married another wife. This new wife
    had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her:
    they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a
    sorry time for the poor little girl. "What does the
    good-for-nothing thing want in the parlour?" said they; "they
    who would eat bread should first earn it; away with the kitchen
    maid!" Then they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an
    old frock to put on, and laughed at her and turned her into the
    kitchen.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>

    <p>Then she was forced to do hard work; to rise early, before
    daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to
    wash. Besides that, the sisters plagued her in all sorts of
    ways and laughed at her. In the evening, when she was tired,
    she had no bed to lie down on, but was made to sleep by the
    hearth among the ashes; and then, as she was of course always
    dusty and dirty, they called her Cinderella.</p>

    <p>It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and
    asked his wife's daughters what he should bring them. "Fine
    clothes," said the first: "Pearls and diamonds," said the
    second. "Now, child," said he to his own daughter, "what will
    you have?" "The first sprig, dear father, that rubs against
    your hat on your way home," said she. Then he bought for the
    two first the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had
    asked for: and on his way home as he rode through a green
    copse, a sprig of hazel brushed against him, and almost pushed
    off his hat; so he broke it off and brought it away; and when
    he got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it and
    went to her mother's grave and planted it there, and cried so
    much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and
    became a fine tree. Three times every day she went to it and
    wept; and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the
    tree, and talked with her and watched over her, and brought her
    whatever she wished for.</p>

    <p>Now it happened that the king of the land held a feast which
    was to last three days, and out of those who came to it his son
    was to choose a bride for himself; and Cinderella's two sisters
    were asked to come. So they called her up and said, "Now, comb
    our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we
    are going to dance at the king's feast." Then she did as she
    was told, but when all was done she could not help crying, for
    she thought to herself, she would have liked to go to the dance
    too; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go.
    "You! Cinderella?" said she; "you who have nothing to wear, no
    clothes at all, and who cannot even dance&mdash;you want to go
    to the ball?" And when she kept on begging&mdash;to get rid of
    her, she said at last, "I will throw this basinful of peas into
    the ash heap, and if you have picked them all out in two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> hours' time you shall go to
       the feast too." Then she threw the peas into the ashes; but
       the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden,
       and cried out&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Hither, hither, through the sky.</p>

            <p>Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!</p>

            <p>Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,</p>

            <p>Hither, hither, haste away!</p>

            <p class="i2">One and all, come help me quick,</p>

            <p>Haste ye, haste ye&mdash;pick, pick, pick!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">

             src="images/027.png"
             alt="Woman sweeping" />
    </div>

    <p>Then first came two white doves flying in at the kitchen
    window; and next came two turtle-doves; and after them all the
    little birds under heaven came chirping and fluttering in, and
    flew down into the ashes; and the little doves stooped their
    heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the
    others began to pick, pick, pick; and picked out all the good
    grain and put it in a dish, and left the ashes. At the end of
    one hour the work was done, and all flew out again at the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
       id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span> windows. Then Cinderella
       brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought
       that now she should go to the feast. But she said, "No, no!
       Girl, you have no clothes and cannot dance, you shall not
       go." And when Cinderella begged very hard to go, she said,
       "If you can in one hour's time pick two of these dishes of
       peas out of the ashes, you shall go too." And thus she
       thought she should at last get rid of her. So she shook two
       dishes of peas into the ashes; but the little maiden went
       out into the garden at the back of the house, and cried as
       before&mdash;</p><br clear="all" />

    </div>

    <p>Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window;
    and next came the turtle-doves; and after them all the little
    birds under heaven came chirping and hopping about, and flew
    down about the ashes; and the little doves put their heads down
    and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began to
    pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain into the
    dishes, and left all the ashes, Before half-an-hour's time all
    was done, and out they flew again. And then Cinderella took the
    dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go
    to the ball. But her mother said, "It is all of no use, you
    cannot go, you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would
    only put us to shame:" and off she went with her two daughters
    to the feast.</p>

    <p>Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Cinderella
    went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried
    out&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Shake, shake, hazel tree,</p>

    </div>

    <p>Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree and brought a
    gold and silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk;
    and she put them on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But
    they did not know her, and thought it must be some strange
    princess, she looked so fine and beautiful in her rich clothes;
    and they never once thought of Cinderella, but took for granted
    that she was safe at home in the dirt.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The king's son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand
    and danced with her and no one else; and he never left her
    hand; but when any one else came to ask her to dance, he said,
    "This lady is dancing with me." Thus they danced till a late
    hour of the night, and then she wanted to go home: and the
    king's son said, "I shall go and take care of you to your
    home;" for he wanted to see where the beautiful maid lived. But
    she slipped away from him unawares, and ran off towards home,
    and the prince followed her; but she jumped up into the
    pigeon-house and shut the door. Then he waited till her father
    came home, and told him that the unknown maiden who had been at
    the feast had hidden herself in the pigeon-house. But when they
    had broken open the door they found no one within; and as they
    came back into the house,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
       id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span> Cinderella lay as she always
       did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little
       lamp burnt in the chimney; for she had run as quickly as she
       could through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and
       had there taken off her beautiful clothes, and laid them
       beneath the tree, that the bird might carry them away, and
       had seated herself amid the ashes again in her little old
       frock.</p>

    <p>The next day, when the feast was again held, and her father,
    mother, and sisters were gone, Cinderella went to the hazel
    tree, and said&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Shake, shake, hazel tree,</p>

            <p>Gold and silver over me!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the
    one she had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the
    ball, every one wondered at her beauty; but the king's son, who
    was waiting for her, took her by the hand, and danced with her;
    and when any one asked her to dance, he said as before, "This
    lady is dancing with me." When night came she wanted to go
    home; and the king's son followed her as before, that he might
    see into what house she went; but she sprang away from him, all
    at once, into the garden behind her father's house. In this
    garden stood a fine large pear tree full of ripe fruit; and
    Cinderella, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into
    it without being seen. Then the king's son could not find out
    where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and
    said to him, "The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped
    away, and I think she must have sprung into the pear tree." The
    father thought to himself, "Can it be Cinderella?" So he
    ordered an axe to be brought; and they cut down the tree, but
    found no one upon it. And when they came back into the kitchen,
    there lay Cinderella in the ashes as usual; for she had slipped
    down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful
    clothes back to the bird at the hazel tree, and then put on her
    little old frock.</p>

    <p>The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were
    gone she went again into the garden, and said&mdash;-</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Shake, shake, hazel tree,</p>

            <p>Gold and silver over me!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer
    than the former ones, and slippers which were all of gold; so
    that when she <!--page 31 contained image-->
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span> came to the feast no one knew
       what to say for wonder at her beauty; and the king's son
       danced with her alone; and when any one else asked her to
       dance he said, "This lady is my partner." Now when night
       came she wanted to go home; and the king's son would go with
       her, and said to himself, "I will not lose her this time;"
       but, however, she managed to slip away from him, though in
       such a hurry that she dropped her left golden slipper upon
       the stairs.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">

        <br />
         "SHE SPRANG AWAY FROM HIM, ALL AT ONCE,<br />
         INTO THE GARDEN BEHIND HER FATHER'S HOUSE."
    </div>

    <p>So the prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the
    king his father, and said, "I will take for my wife the lady
    that this golden shoe fits." Then both the sisters were
    overjoyed to hear this; for they had beautiful feet, and had no
    doubt that they could wear the golden slipper. The eldest went
    first into the room where the slipper was, and wanted to try it
    on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could not go
    into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her.
    Then the mother gave her a knife, and said, "Never mind, cut it
    off; when you are queen you will not care about toes, you will
    not want to go on foot." So the silly girl cut her great toe
    off, and squeezed the shoe on, and went to the king's son. Then
    he took her for his bride, and set her beside him on his horse
    and rode away with her. But on their way home they had to pass
    by the hazel tree that Cinderella had planted and there sat a
    little dove on the branch singing&mdash;-</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Back again! back again! look to the shoe!</p>

            <p>The shoe is too small, and not made for you!</p>

            <p>Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,</p>

            <p>For she's not the true one that sits by thy
            side."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Then the prince got down and looked at her foot, and saw by
    the blood that streamed from it what a trick she had played
    him. So he turned his horse round and brought the false bride
    back to her home, and said, "This is not the right bride; let
    the other sister try and put on the slipper." Then she went
    into the room and got her foot into the shoe, all but the heel,
    which was too large. But her mother squeezed it in till the
    blood came, and took her to the king's son; and he set her as
    his bride beside him on his horse, and rode away with her. But
    when they came to the hazel tree the little dove sat there
    still, and sang&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Back again! back again! look to the shoe!</p>

            <p>Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,</p>

            <p>For she's not the true one that sits by thy
            side."</p>

             alt="Trying on the Shoe" />
    </div>

    <p>Then he looked down and saw that the blood streamed so from
    the shoe that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned
    his horse and brought her back again also. "This is not the
    true bride," said he to the father; "have you no other
    daughters?" "No," said he; "there is only a little dirty
    Cinderella here, the child of my first wife; I am sure she
    cannot be the bride." However, the prince told him to send her.
    But the mother said, "No, no, she is much too dirty, she will
    not dare to show herself;" still the prince would have her
    come. And she first washed her face and hands, and then went in
    and curtsied to him, and he handed to her the golden
    slipper.</p>

    <p>Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot and put on
    the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made
    for her. And when the Prince drew near and looked at her face
    he knew her, and said, "This is the right bride."</p>

    <p>But the mother and both the sisters were frightened and
    turned pale with anger as he took Cinderella on his horse, and
    rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel tree, the
    white dove sang&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Home! home! look at the shoe!</p>

            <p>For she is the true one that sits by thy side!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And when the dove had done its song, it came flying and
    perched upon her shoulder, and so went home with
    her.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"

    <h2>PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR</h2>

    <p>There was once a King's daughter who was the most beautiful
    thing in the world, and as her hair was fair and reached to her
    feet she was called the Princess Goldenhair.</p>

    <p>A handsome young King in the neighbourhood, although he had
    never seen this Princess, fell so deeply in love with her from
    what he had heard, that he could neither eat nor sleep.</p>

    <p>So an ambassador was sent with a magnificent chariot, more
    than a hundred horses, and fifty pages, to bring the Princess
    to the King, and great preparations were made for her
    reception.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <img width="474"

             alt="AN AMBASSADOR WAS SENT WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED HORSES," />
        <br />
         "AN AMBASSADOR WAS SENT WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED
        HORSES,<br />
         AND FIFTY PAGES TO BRING THE PRINCESS TO THE KING."
    </div>

    <p>But whether the Princess Goldenhair was in an ill humour
    when the ambassador arrived at her Court, or whatever was the
    reason, certain it is that she sent a message to the young King
    thanking him but saying that she did not wish to marry.</p>

    <p>When the King heard of her refusal he wept like a child.</p>

    <p>Now at his Court there was a young man called Avenant. He
    was as beautiful as the sun, and a more finely made fellow than
    any in the kingdom; everybody loved him except a few envious
    people, who were angry because the King favoured and confided
    in him, and in the presence of these, one day, Avenant
    incautiously remarked,</p>

    <p>"If the King had sent me to fetch the Princess Goldenhair, I
    am certain she would have come," and these words were repeated
    to the King in such a manner that they made him very angry, and
    he ordered Avenant to be shut up in a high tower, to die of
    hunger.</p>

    <p>In this sad plight, Avenant exclaimed one day, "How have I
    offended his Majesty? He has no more faithful subject than
    I."</p>

    <p>The King who happened to be passing by the tower, heard
    this; he called for Avenant to be brought forth who, throwing
    himself on his knees, begged to know in what way he had
    offended his royal master.</p>

    <p>"You mocked me," said the King, "you said that you would
    have succeeded with the Princess Goldenhair where I have
    failed."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>

    <p>"It is true, sir," replied Avenant, "I did say so, for I
    would have represented your noble qualities in such a way, that
    she could not help being persuaded."</p>

    <p>The King was convinced of the young man's sincerity, and
    with a letter of introduction, Avenant set out for the Court of
    the goldenhaired beauty, riding alone, according to his wish,
    and thinking as he went how he best could woo the Princess for
    his beloved master.</p>

    <p>One day, alighting from his horse to write down some
    suitable words that had come into his mind, he saw a golden
    carp who, leaping from the water to catch flies, had thrown
    herself upon the river bank, and was now nearly dead.</p>

    <p>Avenant pitied the poor thing, and put her carefully back
    into the water. Recovering directly, the carp dived to the
    bottom, but returning to the edge of the river, said,</p>

    <p>"Avenant, I thank you; you have saved my life, I will repay
    you;" then she swam off leaving the young man in great
    astonishment.</p>

    <p>Another day as Avenant journeyed he noticed a raven who was
    pursued by an eagle. "What right has that eagle to persecute
    the raven? thought Avenant, and he drew his bow and shot the
    fierce bird. The raven perched on a bough and cried.</p>

    <p>"Avenant you have saved my life, I will not be ungrateful, I
    will repay you."</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:80%;">

             src="images/035.png"
             alt="Avenant" />
    </div>

    <p>Not long after this, Avenant found an owl caught in a snare,
    he cut the strings, and freed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> the trembling captive.
       "Avenant," said the owl, "you have saved my life, I will
       repay you."</p>

    <p>These three adventures were the most important that befell
    Avenant, and he went on his way, shortly before he arrived at
    his destination purchasing a beautiful little dog named
    Cabriole.</p>

    <p>When Avenant reached the Palace of the Princess Goldenhair,
    and saw the Princess seated upon her throne, she looked so
    lovely that at first all his fine speeches forsook him, and he
    could not utter a word; however, taking courage, he addressed
    her in exquisitely chosen language, begging her to become the
    King's bride.</p>

    <p>To this the Princess replied most graciously, saying that
    his petition moved her more than any other could do, "but
    know," she added, "as I was walking by the river a month ago,
    as I took off my glove, a ring, that I greatly value, fell into
    the water, and I have vowed that I will not heed any proposal
    of marriage, except from the ambassador who brings me back my
    ring."</p>

    <p>Sad at heart Avenant left the Palace, but his little dog,
    Cabriole, said, "My dear master, do not despair, you are too
    good to be unhappy. Early to-morrow morning let us go to the
    river-side." Avenant patted him, but did not answer, and, still
    sad, fell asleep.</p>

    <p>As soon as it was day, Cabriole awoke him saying, "Dress
    yourself, my master, and come out."</p>

    <p>They wandered down to the river, and there Avenant heard a
    voice calling him, and what should he see but the golden carp,
    with the Princess's ring in her mouth. "Take it, dear Avenant,"
    said she, "I promised to repay you for saving my life, and now
    I can fulfil my promise."</p>

    <p>Thanking her a thousand times, Avenant, going at once to the
    Palace, said, "Princess, your command is fulfilled; may it
    please you to receive the King, my master, as your
    husband."</p>

    <p>The Princess thought she must be dreaming when she saw the
    ring, but she set Avenant another task.</p>

             alt="Princess and Avenant" />
    </div>

    <p>"Not far from here there is a prince named Galifron," said
    she; "he wishes to marry me, and threatens to ravish my kingdom
    if I <!--page 37 contained an image-->
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
       id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span> refuse; but how can I accept
       him? He is a giant, taller than my highest tower, he eats a
       man as a monkey would eat a chestnut, and when he speaks,
       his voice is so loud that it deafens those who hear him. He
       will not take my refusal, but kills my subjects. You must
       fight and bring me his head."</p>

    <p>"Well, madam," replied Avenant, "I will fight Galifron; I
    expect I shall be killed, but I shall die a brave man." And,
    taking Cabriole, Avenant set out for Galifron's country, asking
    news of the giant as he went along, and the more he heard the
    more he feared him, but Cabriole reassured him. "My dear
    master," said the little dog, "while you are fighting him I
    will bite his legs, then he will stoop to chase me, and you
    will kill him." Avenant admired the bravery of the little dog,
    but he knew his help would not be sufficient.</p>

    <p>Presently they perceived how the roads were covered with the
    bones of the men that Galifron had eaten, and soon they saw the
    giant coming towards them through a wood. His head was higher
    than the highest trees, and he sang in a terrific voice:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Where are the children small, so small,</p>

            <p>With my teeth I will crush them all,</p>

            <p>On so many would I feed, feed, feed.</p>

            <p>The whole world can't supply my need."</p>
        </div>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>

    <p>Using the same tune, Avenant began to sing:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Look down, here is Avenant beneath, beneath</p>

            <p>He will draw from your head, the teeth, the
            teeth</p>

            <p>Although he is not very big, 'tis true,</p>

            <p>He is able to fight with such as you."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The giant put himself into a terrible passion, and would
    have killed Avenant with one blow, only a raven from above flew
    at his head, and pecked him straight in the eyes, so violently
    that he was blinded. He began striking out on all sides, but
    Avenant avoided his blows, and with his sword pierced him so
    many times that at last he fell to the ground. Then Avenant cut
    off his head, and the raven, who had perched on a tree,
    said,</p>

    <p>"I have not forgotten how you rescued me from the eagle; I
    promised to repay you, I think I have done so to-day."</p>

    <p>"I owe everything to you, Mr. Raven," responded Avenant, as,
    holding Galifron's head, he rode off.</p>

    <p>When he entered the town, crowds followed him crying, "Here
    is the brave Avenant who has slain the monster."</p>

    <p>Avenant advanced to the Princess, and said, "Madam, your
    enemy is dead. I hope you will no more refuse the King, my
    master."</p>

    <p>"Although it is so," answered the Princess, "I shall refuse
    him unless you will bring me some water from the Grotto of
    Darkness. At the entrance there are two dragons, with fire in
    their eyes and mouths; inside the grotto there is a deep pit
    into which you must descend, it is full of toads, scorpions,
    and serpents. At the bottom of this pit there is a little cave
    where flows the fountain of beauty and health. Positively I
    must possess the water; all who wash in it, if they are
    beautiful, continue so always, if they are ugly they become
    beautiful; if they are young they remain young, if they are old
    they regain their youth. You cannot wonder, Avenant, that I
    will not leave my kingdom without taking it with me."</p>

    <p>So once more Avenant and Cabriole set out; they journeyed on
    until they came to a rock, black as ink, from which smoke was
    issuing, and a moment later there appeared one of the dragons
    belching forth fire from his eyes and mouth. He was a frightful
    looking creature with a green and yellow body, and his tail was
    so long that it went into a hundred curves. Avenant saw all
    this, but <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> resolved to die, he drew his
       sword, and, carrying the flask the Princess had given to him
       to hold the water, he said to Cabriole:</p>

    <p>"My days are ended, I can never obtain that water the
    dragons are guarding; when I am dead, fill this flask with my
    blood and carry it to the Princess, that she may know what it
    has cost me, then go to the King, my master, and tell him of my
    misfortune."</p>

    <p>As he was speaking, a voice called, "Avenant, Avenant," and
    looking around he saw an owl. "You saved my life from the
    fowlers," said the owl. "I promised to repay you, the time has
    now come. Give me your flask. I will bring you the water of
    beauty."</p>

    <p>And carrying the flask, the owl entered the grotto,
    unhindered, returning in less than a quarter of an hour with it
    full to the brim. Avenant thanked the owl heartily, and
    joyously started for the town, where he presented the flask to
    the Princess, who immediately gave orders to prepare for her
    departure.</p>

    <p>But as she considered Avenant altogether charming, before
    she set out, she several times said to him: "If you wish, we
    need not go, for I will make you king of my country." But
    Avenant made reply:</p>

    <p>"I would not displease my master for all the kingdoms of
    earth, although your beauty I consider greater than that of the
    sun."</p>

    <p>Thus they arrived at the King's capital, and the wedding
    took place amidst great rejoicings; but Princess Goldenhair,
    who loved Avenant from the depths of her heart, was not happy
    unless she could see him, and was for ever singing his praises.
    "I should not have come, had it not been for Avenant," she told
    the King, "you ought to be very much obliged to him." Then the
    envious courtiers counselled the King, and Avenant was cast
    once more into the tower, chained hand and foot. When Princess
    Goldenhair heard of this imprisonment, she fell on her knees
    before the King, and begged for Avenant's release; but he would
    not heed her, so that she became saddened and would speak no
    more.</p>

    <p>Then the King thought: "Maybe I am not handsome enough to
    please her!" so he determined to wash his face in the water of
    beauty.</p>

    <p>Now it had happened that a chamber-maid had broken the flask
    containing this wonderful water, so that it was all spilled;
    then, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> without saying anything to
       anyone, she had replaced it by a similar flask taken from
       the King's apartment, but the liquid in this flask was
       really that which was used when the princes or great lords
       were condemned to death, for, instead of being beheaded,
       their faces were washed with this water and they fell asleep
       and did not wake again. And so the King using this water one
       evening, thinking it to be the beauty water, and hoping and
       expecting to be made more handsome, went to sleep and awoke
       no more. Upon hearing what had occurred, Cabriole at once
       went and told Avenant, who asked him to go to the Princess
       Goldenhair and beseech her to remember the poor prisoner.
       When the Princess received this message, she went straight
       to the tower, and, with her own hands, struck off the chains
       that bound Avenant, and placing a crown of gold upon his
       head, and a royal mantle upon his shoulders, said: "Come,
       dear Avenant, I will make you King, and take you for my
       husband." Then there was a grand wedding, and Princess
       Goldenhair and Avenant, with Cabriole, lived long, all of
       them happy and contented.</p>

    <h2>LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD</h2>

    <p>Many years ago there lived a dear little girl, who was
    beloved by everyone who knew her; but her grandmother was so
    very fond of her that she never felt that she could think and
    do enough for her.</p>

    <p>On her grand-daughter's birthday she presented her with a
    red silk hood; and as it suited her very well, she would never
    wear anything else; and so she was called Little Red Riding
    Hood. One day her mother said to her, "Come, Red Riding Hood,
    here is a nice piece of meat, and a bottle of wine: take these
    to your grandmother; she is weak and ailing, and they will do
    her good. Be there before she gets up; go quietly and
    carefully; and do not run, or you may fall and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> break the bottle, and then
       your grandmother will have nothing. When you go into her
       room, do not forget to say 'Good-morning'; and do not pry
       into all the corners." "I will do just as you say," answered
       Red Riding Hood, bidding good-bye to her mother.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"

        HOOD
    </div>

    <p>The grandmother lived far away in the wood, a long walk from
    the village, and as Little Red Riding Hood came among the trees
    she met a wolf; but she did not know what a wicked animal it
    was, and so she was not at all frightened. "Good-morning,
    Little Red Riding Hood," he said.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Mr. Wolf," she said.</p>

    <p>"Where are you going so early, Little Red Riding Hood?"</p>

    <p>"To my grandmother's," she answered.</p>

    <p>"And what are you carrying under your apron?"</p>

    <p>"Some wine and meat," she replied. "We baked the meat
    yesterday, so that grandmother, who is very weak, might have a
    nice strengthening meal."</p>

    <p>"And where does your grandmother live?" asked the Wolf.</p>

    <p>"Oh, quite twenty minutes' walk further in the forest. The
    cottage stands under three great oak trees; and close by are
    some nut bushes, by which you will at once know it."</p>

    <p>The wolf was thinking to himself, "She is a nice tender
    thing, and will taste better than the old woman; I must act
    cleverly, that I may make a meal of both."</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <img width="474"
             src="images/044.png"

        <br />
         "WHERE ARE YOU GOING SO EARLY, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD."
    </div>

    <p>Presently he came up again to Little Red Riding Hood and
    said. "Just look at the beautiful flowers which grow near you;
    why do you not look about you? I believe you don't hear how
    sweetly the birds are singing. You walk as if you were going to
    school; see how cheerful everything is around you in the
    forest."</p>

    <p>And Little Red Riding Hood opened her eyes; and when she saw
    how the sunbeams glanced and danced through the trees, and what
    bright flowers were blooming in her path, she thought, "If I
    take my grandmother a fresh nosegay she will be much pleased;
    and it is so very early that I can, even then, get there in
    good time:" and running into the forest she looked about for
    flowers. But when she had once begun she did not know how to
    leave off, and kept going <!-- page contained image-->
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> deeper and deeper among the
       trees looking for some still more beautiful flower. The
       Wolf, however, ran straight to the house of the old
       grandmother, and knocked at the door.</p>

    <p>"Who's that?" asked the old lady.</p>

    <p>"Only little Red Riding Hood, bringing you some meat and
    wine; please open the door," answered the Wolf.</p>

    <p>"Lift up the latch," cried the grandmother; "I am much too
    ill to get up myself."</p>

    <p>So the Wolf lifted the latch, and the door flew open; and
    without a word he jumped on to the bed and gobbled up the poor
    old lady. Then he put on her clothes, and tied her night-cap
    over his head; got into the bed, and drew the blankets over
    him.</p>

    <p>All this time Red Riding Hood was gathering flowers; and
    when she had picked as many as she could carry, she thought of
    her grandmother, and hurried to the cottage. She wondered very
    much to find the door open; and when she got into the room, she
    began to feel very ill, and exclaimed, "How sad I feel! I wish
    I had not come to-day." Then she said, "Good morning," but
    received no reply; so she went up to the bed, and drew back the
    curtains, and there lay her grandmother as she imagined, with
    the cap drawn half over her eyes and looking very fierce.</p>

    <p>"Oh, grandmother, what great ears you have!"</p>

    <p>"All the better to hear you with," was the reply.</p>

    <p>"And what great eyes you have!"</p>

    <p>"All the better to see you with."</p>

    <p>"And what great hands you have!"</p>

    <p>"All the better to touch you with."</p>

    <p>"But, grandmother, what very great teeth you have!"</p>

    <p>"All the better to eat you with;" and hardly were the words
    spoken when the Wolf made a jump out of bed and swallowed down
    poor Little Red Riding Hood also.</p>

    <p>As soon as he had thus satisfied his hunger, he laid himself
    down again on the bed, and went to sleep and snored very
    loudly. A huntsman passing by overheard him, and said, "How
    loudly that old woman snores! I must see if anything is the
    matter."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>

    <p>So he went into the cottage; and when he came to the bed, he
    saw the Wolf sleeping in it.</p>

    <p>"What! are you here, you old rascal? I have been looking for
    you," exclaimed he; and taking up his gun, he shot the old Wolf
    through the head.</p>

    <p>But it is also said that the story ends in a different
    manner; for that one day, when Red Riding Hood was taking some
    presents to her grandmother, a Wolf met her, and wanted to
    mislead her; but she went straight on, and told her grandmother
    that she had met a Wolf, who said good-day; but he looked so
    hungrily out of his great eyes, as if he would have eaten her
    up had she not been on the high road.</p>

    <p>So her grandmother said, "We will shut the door, and then he
    cannot get in."</p>

    <p>Soon after, up came the Wolf, who tapped, and exclaimed, "I
    am Little Red Riding Hood, grandmother; I have some roast meat
    for you." But they kept quite quiet, and did not open the door;
    so the Wolf, after looking several times round the house, at
    last jumped on to the roof, thinking to wait till Red Riding
    Hood went home in the evening, and then to creep after her and
    eat her in the darkness.</p>

    <p>The old woman, however, saw what the villain intended. There
    stood before the door a large stone trough, and she said to
    Little Red Riding Hood, "Take this bucket, dear: yesterday I
    boiled some meat in this water, now pour it into the stone
    trough." Then the Wolf sniffed the smell of the meat, and his
    mouth watered, and he wished very much to taste.</p>

    <p>At last he stretched his neck too far over, so that he lost
    his balance, and fell down from the roof, right into the great
    trough below, and there he was
    drowned.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"

    <h2>THE WHITE FAWN</h2>

    <p>There was once upon a time a King and Queen who were
    perfectly happy, with one exception, and that was that they had
    no child.</p>

    <p>One day when the Queen was staying in a watering-place, some
    distance from home, she was sitting by a fountain alone, sadly
    thinking of the daughter she longed to have, when she perceived
    a crab coming in her direction, who, to the Queen's surprise,
    addressed her thus:</p>

    <p>"Great Queen, if you will condescend to be conducted by a
    humble crab, I will lead you to a Fairies' palace and your wish
    shall be fulfilled."</p>

    <p>"I would certainly come with you," replied the Queen, "but I
    am afraid that I cannot walk backwards."</p>

    <p>The crab smiled, and transforming herself into a beautiful
    little old woman, said:</p>

    <p>"Now, madam, it is not necessary to go backwards. Come with
    me, and I beg of you to look upon me as your friend." She then
    escorted the Queen to the most magnificent palace that could
    possibly be imagined, it was built entirely of diamonds.</p>

    <p>In this superb place dwelt six Fairies who received the
    Queen with the greatest respect, and each one presented her
    with a flower made of precious stones&mdash;a rose, tulip, an
    anemone, a columbine, a violet, and a carnation.</p>

    <p>"Madam," they said, "we have pleasure in telling you that
    soon <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> you will have a daughter whom
       you will name Desirée. Directly she arrives, do not fail to
       call upon us, for we will bestow all sorts of good gifts
       upon her. You have only to hold this bouquet, and mention
       each flower, thinking of us, and be assured that we shall at
       once appear in your chamber."</p>

    <p>The Queen, transported with joy, and overcome with
    gratitude, threw herself upon their necks, and warmly embraced
    them; she then spent several hours admiring the wonders of the
    palace and its gardens, and it was not until evening that she
    returned to her attendants, who were in a serious state of
    anxiety at the prolonged absence of Her Majesty.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <img width="600"
             src="images/049.png"
             alt="Attending to Royalty" />
    </div>

    <p>Not very long afterwards, when the Queen was once more at
    home in her Royal Palace, a baby Princess was born, whom she
    named Desirée. Then taking the bouquet into her hand, the
    Queen, one by one, pronounced the names of the flowers, when
    there immediately appeared, flying through the air in elegant
    chariots drawn by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"
       id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span> different kinds of birds, the
       six Fairies who entered the apartment, bearing beautiful
       presents for the little baby. Marvellously fine linen, but
       so strong that it could be worn a hundred years without
       going into holes, lace of the finest, with the history of
       the world worked into its pattern, toys of all descriptions
       that a child would love to play with, and a cradle
       ornamented with rubies and diamonds, and supported by four
       Cupids ready to rock it should the baby cry. But, best of
       all, the Fairies endowed the little Princess with beauty,
       and virtue, and health, and every good thing that could be
       desired.</p>

    <p>The Queen was thanking the Fairies a thousand times for all
    their favours, when the door opened, and a crab appeared.</p>

    <p>"Ungrateful Queen," said the crab, "you have not deigned to
    remember me, the Fairy of the Fountain; and to punish your
    ingratitude, if the Princess sees daylight before she is
    fifteen years old, she will have cause to repent it, and it may
    cost her her life. It was well I took the form of a crab, for
    your friendship instead of advancing has gone backwards." Then
    in spite of all the Queen and the Fairies could say, the crab
    went backwards out of the door, leaving them in the saddest
    consternation, and it was long before they could decide what
    was best to be done.</p>

    <p>Then, with three waves of a wand, the Fairies caused a high
    tower to spring up; it had neither door nor window, an
    underground passage was made, through which everything
    necessary could be carried, and in this tower the little
    Princess was shut up and there she lived by candlelight, where
    never a glimpse of the sun could come.</p>

    <p>When the Princess Desirée was fourteen years old, the Queen
    had her portrait painted, and copies of it were carried to all
    the Courts in the world. All the Princes admired it greatly,
    but there was one Prince, named Guerrier, who loved it above
    everything; he used to stand before the picture and avow his
    passion, just as if it heard what he said, and at last he told
    the King, his father.</p>

    <p>"You have resolved that I shall marry the Princess Noire,
    but this I can never do, so great is my love for the Princess
    Desirée."</p>

    <p>"But where have you seen her?" enquired the King.</p>

    <p>The Prince hastened to fetch her portrait, and the King was
    so <!--page contained image-->
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
       id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> greatly struck by Desirée's
       beauty that he agreed to follow his son's wishes and break
       off his engagement with the Princess Noire, that he might
       wed the Princess Desirée. So the King despatched as
       ambassador a rich young lord named Bécafigue.</p>

    <p>Bécafigue was devoted to Prince Guerrier, and he fitted out
    a most splendid retinue to visit the Princess Desirée's Court.
    Besides numerous magnificent presents, Bécafigue took with him
    the Prince's portrait, which had been painted by such a clever
    artist that it would speak; it could not exactly answer
    questions, but could make certain remarks. It was truly a
    speaking likeness of the young Prince. Desirée's father and
    mother were delighted when they heard that the Prince Guerrier
    was seeking their daughter's hand in marriage, for they knew
    him to be a brave and noble young man. But as it still wanted
    three months to the Princess's fifteenth year, warned by the
    Fairy Tulip, who had taken Desirée under her special care, they
    refused to let him see their daughter or to let her yet marry
    the Prince Guerrier, but they showed her the Prince's portrait,
    with which she was greatly pleased, and particularly when it
    said, "Lovely Desirée, you cannot imagine how ardently I am
    waiting for you; come soon into our Court to make it beautiful
    by your presence."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:70%;">
        <img width="400"
             src="images/052.png"
             alt="Ugly Royalty" />
    </div>

    <p>When Prince Guerrier saw the ambassador return without
    Desirée, he was so terribly disappointed that he could neither
    eat nor sleep, and before long fell dangerously ill.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Desirée had no less pleasure in looking at the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> Prince's portrait than he had
       had admiring hers, and this was soon discovered by those
       around her, and among others Giroflée and Longue Epine, her
       maids of honour. Giroflée loved her passionately and
       faithfully, but Longue Epine was full of envy of the
       Princess who was so good and beautiful, and, besides Longue
       Epine, Desirée had another enemy, and that was the Princess
       Noire, to whom Prince Guerrier had been betrothed. This
       Princess Noire now went to the Fairy of the Fountain, who
       was her best friend, and begged her to take revenge upon
       Princess Desirée, and this the Fairy promised to do.
       Meanwhile once more Bécafigue came to the capital where
       Desirée's father lived, and throwing himself at the King's
       feet, besought him in most touching words to let his
       daughter go with him at once to the Prince, who would surely
       die if he could not behold her.</p>

    <p>When Princess Desirée heard of the Prince's illness, she
    suggested that she should set out without delay, but in a dark
    carriage, that only at night should be opened to give her food.
    This plan was approved of; the ambassador was told, and he
    departed full of joy. So in a carriage like a large dark box,
    shut up with her Lady in Waiting and her two Maids of Honour,
    Giroflée and Longue Epine, Princess Desirée departed for Prince
    Guerrier's Court.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you will remember that Longue Epine did not like
    Princess Desirée, but she greatly admired Prince Guerrier, for
    she had seen his portrait speaking, and she had told her
    mother, the Lady in Waiting, that she should die if he married
    Desirée.</p>

    <p>The King and Queen had begged the Lady in Waiting to take
    the greatest of care of their dear daughter, and above all to
    be heedful that she did not see the light of day until her
    fifteenth birthday, saying that the ambassador had promised
    that until then she should be placed where there was no other
    light than that of candles. But now as they drew near their
    destination, while it was broad daylight the wicked woman,
    urged by her envious daughter, Longue Epine, all at once took a
    large knife which she had brought for the purpose, and with it
    cut the covering of the carriage.</p>

    <p>Then, for the first time, the Princess Desirée saw the light
    of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
       id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> day!!! Hardly had she
       perceived it when, uttering a deep sigh, she threw herself
       from the carriage, and in the form of a white fawn fleetly
       fled into a forest near by.</p>

    <p>The Fairy of the Fountain, who was the cause of this
    disaster seeing that all who were accompanying the Princess
    were about to hasten to the town to tell the Prince Guerrier
    what had happened, called up a great thunderstorm and scattered
    them in every direction. Only the Lady in Waiting, Longue Epine
    and Giroflée were left, Giroflée, who ran after her mistress,
    making the trees and rocks echo with her mournful calls. Then
    Longue Epine clothed herself in the rich bridal robes provided
    for Desirée. She placed the crown upon her head, the sceptre
    and orb she carried in her hands, so that all should take her
    for the Princess. With her mother bearing her train she gravely
    walked in the direction of the town.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"

        <br />
         "A GREAT THUNDERSTORM SCATTERED THEM IN EVERY DIRECTION."
    </div>

    <p>They had not gone far when a brilliant procession came
    towards them, amongst whom was the sick Prince in a litter, and
    to those in advance Longue Epine announced that she was the
    Princess Desirée, with her Lady in Waiting, but that a jealous
    Fairy had sent a thunderstorm which had destroyed her carriage
    and scattered her other attendants. When the Prince was told of
    this, he could not refrain from saying to the messengers: "Now
    acknowledge, is she not truly a miracle of beauty, a Princess
    beyond compare?"</p>

    <p>No one replied at first, and then one of the boldest
    said,</p>

    <p>"Sir, you will see; apparently the fatigue of the journey
    has somewhat changed her." The Prince was surprised, but when
    he saw Longue Epine words fail to express what he felt.</p>

    <p>She was so tall that it was alarming, and the garments of
    the Princess hardly came to her knees. She was frightfully
    thin, and her nose, which was more hooked than a parrot's beak,
    shone like a danger signal. Then her teeth were black and
    uneven, and, in fact, she was as ugly as Desirée was
    beautiful.</p>

    <p>At first the Prince could not speak a word, he simply gazed
    at her in amazement. Then he said, turning to his father, "We
    have been deceived, that portrait was painted to mislead us. It
    will be the death of
    me."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>

    <p>"What do I hear, they have deceived you," fiercely exclaimed
    Longue Epine.</p>

    <p>"It is not to be wondered at," remarked the King, "that your
    father kept such a treasure shut up for fifteen years."</p>

    <p>Then he and the Prince turned towards the town, and the
    false Princess and the Lady in Waiting, without any ceremony,
    were mounted each behind a soldier and taken to be shut up in a
    castle.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">

        <p><i>Painted by Jennie Harbour</i></p>THE WHITE FAWN
    </div>

    <p>Soon after his terrible disappointment, Prince Guerrier,
    unable to bear any longer the life at court, secretly departed
    from the palace with his faithful friend Bécafigue, leaving a
    letter for his father saying he would return to him as soon as
    his mind was in a happier state, and begging him meanwhile to
    keep the ugly Princess prisoner, and think of some revenge upon
    the deceitful king, her father.</p>

    <p>After three or four days' journeying, the wanderers found
    themselves in a thick forest. Quite wearied out, the Prince
    threw himself upon the ground, while Bécafigue went on further
    in search of fruit wherewith to refresh his royal master.</p>

    <p>It is a long time since we left the White Fawn, that is to
    say the charming Princess.</p>

    <p>Very desolately she wept when in a stream she saw her figure
    reflected, and when night came she was in great fear, for she
    heard wild beasts about her, and sometimes forgetting she was a
    fawn she would try to climb a tree. But with morning dawn she
    felt a little safer, and the sun appeared a marvellous sight to
    her from which she could hardly turn her eyes. But now the
    Fairy Tulip, who had always loved the Princess guided
    Giroflée's feet in her direction, and when the White Fawn saw
    her faithful Maid of Honour her delight was boundless.</p>

    <p>It did not take Giroflée long to discover that this was her
    dearly-loved mistress, and she promised the White Fawn never to
    forsake her, for she found she could hear all that was said
    although she could not speak. Towards night the fear of having
    no shelter made the two friends so dreadfully dismayed that the
    Fairy Tulip suddenly appeared before them.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <img width="600"
             src="images/056.png"
             alt="Prince and Fawn" />
    </div>

    <p>"I am not going to scold you," she said, "although it is
    through <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
       id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span> not following my advice that
       you are in this misfortune, for it goes to my heart to see
       you thus. I cannot release you altogether from this
       enchantment, but I have power to shorten the time, and also
       to say that during the night you may regain your rightful
       form, but by day again must you run through the forest as a
       Fawn." The fairy also told them where they could find a
       little hut in which to pass the nights. Then she
       disappeared. Giroflée and the Fawn walked in the direction
       the Fairy had pointed out, and arrived at a neat little
       cottage where an old woman showed them a room which they
       could occupy.</p>

    <p>As soon as it was night Desirée came to her rightful form,
    but when day appeared she was once more a Fawn and, escaping
    into the thicket, commenced to run about in the ordinary
    way.</p>

    <p>You have heard how Prince Guerrier rested in the forest
    while Bécafigue searched for fruit; quite late in the evening
    Bécafigue arrived at the cottage of the good woman who had
    given shelter to Giroflée and the White Fawn. He addressed her
    politely and asked <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> for the things he required
       for his master. She hastened to fill a basket, and gave it
       to him, saying, "I fear that if you pass a night without
       shelter some harm may come to you. I can offer you a poor
       one, but at any rate it is secure from the lions."</p>

    <p>Bécafigue went back to the Prince and together they returned
    to the cottage, where they were led into the room next to that
    occupied by the Princess.</p>

    <p>Next morning the Prince arose early and went out; he had not
    long been in the forest when he saw a beautiful little Fawn.
    Hunting had ever been his favourite pastime, and now he pursued
    the little creature. All day long hither and thither he chased,
    but did not succeed in capturing her, and as evening fell the
    Fawn slipped away and gained the little hut where Giroflée
    anxiously awaited her, and on hearing her adventure the Maid of
    Honour told her she must never again venture out, but the
    Princess replied:</p>

    <p>"It is no use talking thus, when I am a Fawn this room is
    stifling to me and I must depart from it."</p>

    <p>The next day the young Prince sought in vain for the White
    Fawn, and finally tired out threw himself upon the grass and
    fell asleep.</p>

    <p>While he lay there the little Fawn drew near and looking at
    him quietly, to her astonishment she recognised his features as
    those of the Prince Guerrier. Coming nearer and nearer she
    presently touched him and he awoke.</p>

    <p>His surprise was great at seeing close by the shy little
    Fawn, who stayed not an instant longer but fled away, the
    Prince following.</p>

    <p>"Stay, dear little Fawn," he cried, "I would not hurt you
    for the world." But the wind carried off the words before they
    reached her ears. Long he chased the poor creature, till at
    last worn out the Fawn sank down on the ground and the Prince
    came up to her.</p>

    <p>"Beautiful Fawn," said he, "do not fear me, I shall lead you
    with me everywhere." Then he covered her with roses and fed her
    with the choicest leaves and grasses.</p>

    <p>But as evening drew near the Fawn longed to escape, for what
    would happen should she suddenly change into a Princess there
    in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> the forest. Presently the
       Prince went to fetch some water for her, and while he was
       gone she ran homewards. The next day for a long time she hid
       from the Prince, but at last he found her, and as she dashed
       off he shot an arrow which wounded her in the leg.</p>

    <p>Sad that he should have done so cruel a thing, the Prince
    took herbs and laid them upon the wound, and at last he went to
    fetch Bécafigue to help him carry her to the house. He tied her
    to a tree.</p>

    <p>Alas! Who would have thought that the most beautiful
    Princess in the world would be treated thus? While she was
    straining at the ribbons trying to break them, Giroflée
    arrived, and was leading her away when the Prince met them and
    claimed the Fawn as his.</p>

    <p>"Sir," politely replied Giroflée, "the Fawn was mine before
    it was yours," and she spoke to the Fawn, and the Fawn obeyed
    her in such a way that the Prince could not doubt that what she
    said was true. Giroflée then went on, and, to the surprise of
    the Prince and Bécafigue, entered the old woman's house where
    they themselves lodged. Then Bécafigue told the Prince that
    unless he was much mistaken the owner of the Fawn had lived
    with the Princess Desirée when he went there as ambassador.</p>

    <p>"I mean to see her again," said Bécafigue, "there is only a
    partition between her room and ours." And soon he had made a
    hole large enough to peep through, and through it he saw the
    charming Princess dressed in a robe of brocaded silver, with
    flowers embroidered in gold and emeralds, her hair falling in
    heavy masses on the most beautiful neck in the world. Giroflée
    was on her knees before her, bandaging up one arm from which
    the blood was flowing. They both seemed greatly concerned about
    the wound: "Let me die," the Princess was saying, "death would
    be better than the life which I lead. To be a Fawn all the day,
    to hear him speaking, and not to be able to tell him of my sad
    fate."</p>

    <p>One can guess the astonishment of Bécafigue and of the
    Prince. Guerrier would almost have died of pleasure had he not
    thought that it must be some enchantment, for did he not know
    that Desirée and her Lady in Waiting were shut up in the
    castle.</p>

    <p>He went softly and knocked at the chamber door, which
    Giroflée <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
       id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> opened, thinking it was the
       old woman, for she required help for the wounded arm.</p>

    <p>The Prince entered, threw himself at Desirée's feet, and
    found she was indeed his Princess.</p>

    <p>Great was their joy thus at last meeting, and while they
    were talking to each other the night passed, and the day
    dawned, and daylight came, and the morning sun shone brightly
    before Desirée had time to notice that she had not again taken
    the shape of a Fawn, but was her own beautiful self.</p>

    <p>Then it was found that it was the Fairy Tulip in disguise of
    the old woman who had provided that sheltering cottage in the
    forest.</p>

    <p>The joy of the King upon once more seeing his son can well
    be imagined, and the marriage of the Prince and Desirée, and
    Bécafigue and Giroflée took place on the same day, the Fairies
    giving their diamond palace as their wedding present to
    Princess Desirée, and Fairy Tulip presenting four gold mines in
    the Indies to Giroflée.</p>

    <h2>HANSEL AND GRETHEL</h2>

    <p>Once upon a time there dwelt near a large wood a poor wood
    cutter, with his wife, and two children by his former marriage,
    a little boy called Hansel, and a girl named Grethel. He had
    little enough to break or bite; and once, when there was a
    great famine in the land, he could hardly procure even his
    daily bread; and as he lay thinking in his bed one night, he
    sighed, and said to his wife, "What will become of us? How can
    we feed our children, when we have no more than we can eat
    ourselves?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
       id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>

    <p>"Know then, my husband," answered she, "we will lead them
    away, quite early in the morning, into the thickest part of the
    wood, and there make them a fire, and give them each a little
    piece of bread, then we will go to our work, and leave them
    alone, so they will not find the way home again, and we shall
    be freed from them."</p>

    <p>"No, wife," replied he, "that I can never do; how can you
    bring your heart to leave my children all alone in the wood;
    for the wild beasts will soon come and tear them to
    pieces?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, you simpleton!" said she, "then we must all four die of
    hunger; you had better plane the coffins for us." But she left
    him no peace till he consented, saying, "Ah, but I shall miss
    the poor children."</p>

    <p>The two children, however, had not gone to sleep, for very
    hunger, and so they overheard what the stepmother said to their
    father. Grethel wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, "What will
    become of us?"</p>

    <p>"Be quiet, Grethel," said he; "do not cry&mdash;I will help
    you." And as soon as their parents had gone to sleep, he got
    up, put on his coat, and, unbarring the back door, went out.
    The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay before
    the door seemed like silver pieces, they glittered so brightly.
    Hansel stooped down, and put as many into his pocket as it
    would hold; and then going back he said to Grethel, "Be of good
    cheer, dear sister, and sleep in peace; God will not forsake
    us." And so saying, he went to bed again.</p>

    <p>The next morning, before the sun arose, the wife went and
    awoke the two children. "Get up, you lazy things; we are going
    into the forest to chop wood." Then she gave them each a piece
    of bread, saying, "There is something for your dinner; do not
    eat it before the time, for you will get nothing else." Grethel
    took the bread in her apron, for Hansel's pocket was full of
    pebbles; and so they all set out upon their way. When they had
    gone a little distance, Hansel stood still, and peeped back at
    the house; and this he repeated several times, till his father
    said, "Hansel, what are you looking at, and why do you lag
    behind? Take care, and remember your
    legs."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"
       id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>

    <p>"Ah, father," said Hansel, "I am looking at my white cat
    sitting upon the roof of the house, and trying to say
    good-bye."</p>

    <p>"You simpleton!" said the wife, "that is not a cat; it is
    only the sun shining on the white chimney." But in reality
    Hansel was not looking at a cat; but every time he stopped, he
    dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path.</p>

    <p>When they came to the middle of the forest, the father told
    the children to collect wood, and he would make them a fire, so
    that they should not be cold. So Hansel and Grethel gathered
    together quite a little mount of twigs. Then they set fire to
    them; and as the flame burnt up high, the wife said, "Now, you
    children, lie down near the fire, and rest yourselves, whilst
    we go into the forest and chop more wood; when we are ready we
    will come and call you."</p>

    <p>Hansel and Grethel sat down by the fire, and when it was
    noon, each ate the piece of bread; and because they could hear
    the blows of an axe they thought their father was near; but it
    was not an axe, but a branch which he had bound to an old tree,
    so as to be blown to and fro by the wind. They waited so long,
    that at last their eyes closed from weariness, and they fell
    fast asleep. When they awoke, it was quite dark, and Grethel
    began to cry. "How shall we get out of the wood?" But Hansel
    tried to comfort her by saying, "Wait a little while till the
    moon rises, and then we will quickly find the way." The moon
    shone forth, and Hansel, taking his sister's hand, followed the
    pebbles, which glittered like new-coined silver pieces, and
    showed them the way. All night long they walked on, and as day
    broke they came to their father's house. They knocked at the
    door, and when the wife opened it, and saw Hansel and Grethel,
    she exclaimed, "You wicked children! Why did you sleep so long
    in the wood? We thought you were never coming home again." But
    their father was extremely glad, for it had grieved his heart
    to leave them all alone.</p>

         "HANSEL AND GRETHEL SAT DOWN BY THE FIRE."
    </div>

    <p>Not long afterwards there was again great scarcity in every
    corner of the land; and one night the children overheard their
    mother saying to their father, "Everything is once more
    consumed; we have only half a loaf left, and then the song is
    ended: the children <!--page 63 contained image-->
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
       id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> must be sent away. We will
       take them deeper into the wood, so that they may not find
       the way out again; it is the only means of escape for
       us."</p>

    <p>But her husband felt heavy at heart, and thought, "It were
    better to share the last crust with the children." His wife,
    however, would listen to nothing that he said, and scolded and
    reproached him without end.</p>

    <p>He who says A must say B too; and he who consents the first
    time must also the second.</p>

    <p>The children, however, had heard the conversation as they
    lay awake, and as soon as their parents went to sleep Hansel
    got up, intending to pick up some pebbles as before; but the
    wife had locked the door, so that he could not get out.
    Nevertheless he comforted Grethel, saying, "Do not weep; sleep
    in quiet; the good God will not forsake us."</p>

    <p>Early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out
    of bed, and gave them each a slice of bread, which was still
    smaller than the former piece. On the way Hansel broke his in
    his pocket, and stopping every now and then, dropped a crumb
    upon the path. "Hansel, why do you stop and look about?" said
    the father, "keep in the path." "I am looking at my little
    dove," answered Hansel, "nodding a good-bye to me."
    "Simpleton!" said the wife, "that is no dove, but only the sun
    shining on the chimney." But Hansel kept still dropping crumbs
    as he went along.</p>

    <p>The mother led the children deep into the wood, where they
    had never been before, and there making a gigantic fire, she
    said to them, "Sit down here and rest, and when you feel tired
    you can sleep for a little while. We are going into the forest
    to hew wood, and in the evening, when we are ready, we will
    come and fetch you again."</p>

    <p>When noon came, Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who
    had strewn his on the path. They then went to sleep; but the
    evening arrived and no one came to visit the poor children, and
    in the dark night they awoke, and Hansel comforted his sister
    by saying, "Only wait, Grethel, till the moon comes out, then
    we shall see <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> the crumbs of bread which I
       have dropped, and they will show us the way home." The moon
       shone and they got up, but they could not see any crumbs,
       for the thousands of birds which had been flying about in
       the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel kept
       saying to Grethel, "We will soon find the way;" but they did
       not, and they walked the whole night long and the next day,
       but still they did not come out of the wood; and they got
       very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the berries
       which they found upon the bushes. Soon they were so tired
       that they could not drag themselves along, then they lay
       down under a tree and again went to sleep.</p>

    </div>

    <p>It was now the third morning since they had left their
    father's house, and they still walked on; but they only got
    deeper, and deeper, and deeper into the wood, and Hansel felt
    that if help did not come very soon they must die of hunger. As
    soon as it was noon they saw a beautiful, snow-white bird
    sitting upon a bough, singing so sweetly that they stood still
    and listened to it. It soon ceased, and spreading its wings
    flew off; and they followed it until it arrived at a cottage,
    upon the roof of which it perched; and when they went close up
    to it they saw that the cottage was made of bread and cakes,
    and the window-panes were of clear sugar.</p>

    <p>"We will go in here," said Hansel, "and have a glorious
    feast. I will eat a piece of the roof, and you can eat the
    window. Will they not be sweet?" So Hansel reached up and broke
    a piece off the roof, in order to see how it tasted; while
    Grethel stepped up to the window and began to bite it. Then a
    sweet voice called out in the room, "Tip-tap, tip-tap, who
    knocks at my door?" and the children answered, "The wind, the
    wind, the child of heaven;" and they went on eating without
    interruption. Hansel thought the roof tasted very nice, and so
    he tore off a great piece; while Grethel broke a large round
    pane out of the window, and sat down quite contentedly. Just
    then the door opened, and a very old woman, walking upon
    crutches, came out. Hansel and Grethel were so much frightened
    that they let fall what they had in their hands; but the old
    woman nodding her head, said, "Ah, you dear children, what has
    brought you here? Come in and stop with me, and no harm
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> shall come to you;" and so
       saying she took them both by the hand, and led them into her
       cottage. A good meal of milk and pancakes, with sugar,
       apples and nuts, was spread on the table, and in the back
       room were two nice little beds, covered with white, where
       Hansel and Grethel laid themselves down, and were happy as
       could be. The old woman behaved very kindly to them, but in
       reality she was a wicked old witch who way-laid children,
       and built the breadhouse in order to entice them in; but as
       soon as they were in her power she killed them, cooked and
       ate them, and made a great festival of the day. Witches have
       red eyes, and cannot see very far; but they have a fine
       sense of smelling, like wild beasts, so that they know when
       children approach them. When Hansel and Grethel came near
       the witch's house she laughed wickedly, saying, "Here come
       two who shall not escape me." And early in the morning,
       before they awoke, she went up to them, and saw how lovingly
       they lay sleeping, with their chubby red cheeks; and she
       mumbled to herself, "That will be a good bite." Then she
       took up Hansel with her rough hand, and shut him up in a
       little cage with a lattice-door; and although he screamed
       loudly it was of no use. Grethel came next, and shaking her
       till she awoke, she said, "Get up, you lazy brat, and fetch
       some water to cook something good for your brother, who must
       remain in that stall and get fat; and when he is fat enough
       I shall eat him." Grethel began to cry, but it was all
       useless, for the old witch made her do as she wanted. So a
       nice meal was cooked for Hansel, but Grethel got nothing
       else but a crab's claw.</p>

    <p>Every morning the old witch came to the cage and said,
    "Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel whether you
    are getting fat." But Hansel used to stretch out a bone, and
    the old woman, having very bad sight, thought it was his
    finger, and wondered very much why he did not get fat. When
    four weeks had passed, and Hansel still kept quite lean, she
    lost all her patience, and would not wait any longer.
    "Grethel," she cried in a passion, "get some water quickly; be
    Hansel fat or lean, this morning I will kill and cook him." Oh,
    how the poor little sister grieved, as she was forced to fetch
    the water, and fast the tears ran down her cheeks! "Dear good
    God, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
       id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span> help us now!" she prayed.
       "Had we only been eaten by the wild beasts in the wood, then
       we should have died together." But the old witch called out,
       "Leave off that noise; it will not help you a bit."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <img width="350"
             src="images/067.png"
             alt="The witch" />
    </div>

    <p>So early in the morning Grethel was compelled to go out and
    fill the kettle, and make a fire. "First, we will bake,
    however," said the old woman; "I have already heated the oven
    and kneaded the dough;" and so saying, she pushed poor Grethel
    up to the oven, out of which the flames were burning fiercely.
    "Creep in," said the witch, "and see if it is hot enough, and
    then we will put in the bread," but she intended when Grethel
    got in, to shut up the oven and let her bake, so that she might
    eat her as well as Hansel. Grethel perceived her wicked
    thoughts and said, "I do not know how to do it; how shall I get
    in?" "You stupid goose," said she, "the opening is big enough.
    See, I could even get in myself!" and she got up, and put her
    head into the oven. Then Grethel gave her a push, so that she
    fell right in, and shutting the iron door bolted it. Oh! how
    horribly the witch howled; but Grethel ran away, and left her
    to burn to ashes.</p>

    <p>Now she ran to Hansel, and, opening the door, called out,
    "Hansel we are saved; the old witch is dead?"</p>

    <p>So he sprang out, like a bird from his cage when the door
    was opened; and they were so glad that they fell upon each
    other's neck, and kissed each other over and over again. And
    now, as there was nothing to fear, they went back to the
    witch's <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> house, where in every corner
       were caskets full of pearls and precious stones. "These are
       better than pebbles," said Hansel, putting as many into his
       pocket as it would hold; while Grethel thought, "I will take
       some home too," and filled her apron full.</p>

    <p>"We must be off now," said Hansel, "and get out of this
    enchanted forest;" but when they had walked for two hours they
    came to a large piece of water.</p>

    <p>"We cannot get over," said Hansel; "I can see no bridge at
    all." "And there is no boat either," said Grethel, "but there
    swims a white duck, I will ask her to help us over;" and she
    sang,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Little Duck, good little Duck,</p>

            <p class="i2">Grethel and Hansel, together we
            stand;</p>

            <p>There is neither stile nor bridge,</p>

            <p class="i2">Take us on your back to land."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="figleft"

             src="images/068.png"
             alt="Duck ferrying Grethel" />
    </div>

    <p>So the Duck came to them, and Hansel sat himself on, and
    bade his sister sit beside him. "No," replied Grethel, "that
    will be too much for the Duck, she shall take us over one at a
    time." This the good little bird did, and when both were
    happily arrived on the other side, and had gone a little way,
    they came to a well-known wood, which they knew the better
    every step they went, and at last they perceived their father's
    house. Then they began to run, and rushing into the house, they
    fell upon their father's neck. He had not had one happy hour
    since he had left the children in the forest; and his wife was
    dead. Grethel shook her apron, and the pearls and precious
    stones rolled out upon the floor, and Hansel threw down one
    handful after the other out of his pocket. Then all their
    sorrows were ended, and they lived together in great
    happiness.</p><br />

    <h2>SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED</h2>

    <p>A poor widow once lived in a little cottage. In front of the
    cottage was a garden, in which were growing two rose trees; one
    of these bore white roses, and the other red.</p>

    <p>She had two children, who resembled the rose trees. One was
    called Snow-White, and the other Rose-Red; and they were as
    religious and loving, busy and untiring, as any two children
    ever were.</p>

    <p>Snow-White was more gentle, and quieter than her sister, who
    liked better skipping about the fields, seeking flowers, and
    catching summer birds; while Snow-White stayed at home with her
    mother, either helping her in her work, or, when that was done,
    reading aloud.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
       id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>

    <p>The two children had the greatest affection the one for the
    other. They were always seen hand in hand; and should
    Snow-White say to her sister, "We will never separate," the
    other would reply, "Not while we live," the mother adding,
    "That which one has, let her always share with the other."</p>

    <p>They constantly ran together in the woods, collecting ripe
    berries; but not a single animal would have injured them; quite
    the reverse, they all felt the greatest esteem for the young
    creatures. The hare came to eat parsley from their hands, the
    deer grazed by their side, the stag bounded past them
    unheeding; the birds, likewise, did not stir from the bough,
    but sang in entire security. No mischance befell them; if
    benighted in the wood, they lay down on the moss to repose and
    sleep till the morning; and their mother was satisfied as to
    their safety, and felt no fear about them.</p>

    <p>Once, when they had spent the night in the wood, and the
    bright sunrise awoke them, they saw a beautiful child, in a
    snow-white robe, shining like diamonds, sitting close to the
    spot where they had reposed. She arose when they opened their
    eyes, and looked kindly at them; but said no word, and passed
    from their sight into the wood. When the children looked around
    they saw they had been sleeping on the edge of a precipice, and
    would surely have fallen over if they had gone forward two
    steps further in the darkness. Their mother said the beautiful
    child must have been the angel who watches over good
    children.</p>

    <p>Snow-White and Rose-Red kept their mother's cottage so clean
    that it gave pleasure only to look in. In summer-time Rose-Red
    attended to the house, and every morning, before her mother
    awoke, placed by her bed a bouquet which had in it a rose from
    each of the rose-trees. In winter-time Snow-White set light to
    the fire, and put on the kettle, after polishing it until it
    was like gold for brightness. In the evening, when snow was
    falling, her mother would bid her bolt the door, and then,
    sitting by the hearth, the good widow would read aloud to them
    from a big book while the little girls were spinning. Close by
    them lay a lamb, and a white pigeon, with its head tucked under
    its wing, was on a perch
    behind.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
       id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <img width="400"
             src="images/071.png"
             alt="Facing the Bear" />
    </div>

    <p>One evening, as they were all sitting cosily together like
    this, there was a knock at the door, as if someone wished to
    come in.</p>

    <p>"Make haste, Rose-Red!" said her mother; "open the door; it
    is surely some traveller seeking shelter." Rose-Red accordingly
    pulled back the bolt, expecting to see some poor man. But it
    was nothing of the kind; it was a bear, that thrust his big
    head in at the open door. Rose-Red cried out and sprang back,
    the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered her wings and Snow-White
    hid herself behind her mother's bed. The bear began speaking,
    and said, "Do not be afraid: I will not do you any harm; I am
    half-frozen, and would like to warm myself a little at your
    fire."</p>

    <p>"Poor bear!" the mother replied; "come in and lie by the
    fire; only be careful that your hair is not burnt." Then she
    called Snow-White and Rose-Red, telling them that the bear was
    kind, and would not harm them. They came, as she bade them, and
    presently the lamb and the dove drew near also without
    fear.</p>

    <p>"Children," begged the bear; "knock some of the snow off my
    coat." So they brought the broom and brushed the bear's coat
    quite clean.</p>

    <p>After that he stretched himself out in front of the fire,
    and pleased himself by growling a little, only to show that he
    was happy and comfortable. Before long they were all quite good
    friends, and the children began to play with their unlooked for
    visitor, pulling his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"

       feet on his back, or rolling him over and over. Then they
       took a slender hazel twig, using it upon his thick coat, and
       they laughed when he growled. The bear permitted them to
       amuse themselves in this way, only occasionally calling out,
       when it went a little too far, "Children, spare me an inch
       of life!"</p>

    <p>When it was night, and all were making ready to go to bed,
    the widow told the bear, "You may stay here and lie by the
    hearth, if you like, so that you will be sheltered from the
    cold and from the bad weather."</p>

    <p>The offer was accepted, but when morning came, as the day
    broke in the east, the two children let him out, and over the
    snow he went back into the wood.</p>

    <p>After this, every evening at the same time the bear came,
    lay by the fire, and allowed the children to play with him; so
    they became quite fond of their curious playmate, and the door
    was not ever bolted in the evening until he had appeared.</p>

    <p>When springtime came, and all around began to look green and
    bright, one morning the bear said to Snow-White, "Now I must
    leave you, and all the summer long I shall not be able to come
    back."</p>

    <p>"Where, then, are you going, dear bear?" asked Snow-White.
    "I have to go to the woods to protect my treasure from the bad
    dwarfs. In winter time when the earth is frozen hard, they must
    remain underground, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
       id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> and cannot make their way
       through; but now that the sunshine has thawed the earth they
       can come to the surface, and whatever gets into their hands,
       or is brought to their caves, seldom, if ever, again sees
       daylight."</p>

    <p>Snow-White was very sad when she said good-bye to the
    good-natured beast, and unfastened the door, that he might go;
    but in going out he was caught by a hook in the lintel, and a
    scrap of his fur being torn, Snow-White thought there was
    something shining like gold through the rent; but he went out
    so quickly that she could not feel certain what it was, and
    soon he was hidden among the trees.</p>

    <p>One day the mother sent her children into the wood to pick
    up sticks. They found a big tree lying on the ground. It had
    been felled, and towards the roots they noticed something
    skipping and springing, which they could not make out, as it
    was sometimes hidden in the grasses. As they came nearer they
    could see it was a dwarf, with a shrivelled up face and a
    snow-white beard an ell long. The beard was fixed in a gash in
    the tree trunk, and the tiny fellow was hopping to and fro,
    like a dog at the end of a string, but he could not manage to
    free himself. He stared at the children, with his red, fiery
    eyes, and called out, "Why are you standing there? Can't you
    come and try to help me?"</p>

    <p>"What were you doing, little fellow?" enquired Rose-Red.</p>

    <p>"Stupid, inquisitive goose!" replied the dwarf; "I meant to
    split the trunk, so that I could chop it up for kitchen sticks;
    big logs would burn up the small quantity of food we cook, for
    people like us do not consume great heaps of food, as you
    heavy, greedy folk do. The bill-hook I had driven in, and soon
    I should have done what I required; but the tool suddenly
    sprang from the cleft, which so quickly shut up again that it
    caught my handsome white beard; and here I must stop, for I
    cannot set myself free. You stupid, pale-faced creatures! You
    laugh, do you?"</p>

    <p>In spite of the dwarf's bad temper, the girls took all
    possible pains to release the little man, but without avail;
    the beard could not be moved, it was wedged too
    tightly.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"
       id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>

    <p>"I will run and get someone else," said Rose-Red.</p>

    <p>"Idiot!" cried the dwarf. "Who would go and get more people?
    Already there are two too many. Can't you think of something
    better?"</p>

    <p>"Don't be so impatient," said Snow-White. "I will try to
    think." She clapped her hands as if she had discovered a
    remedy, took out her scissors, and in a moment set the dwarf
    free by cutting off the end of his beard.</p>

    <p>Immediately the dwarf felt that he was free he seized a
    sackful of gold that was hidden among the tree roots, and,
    lifting it up, grumbled out, "Clumsy creatures, to cut off a
    bit of my beautiful beard, of which I am so proud! I leave the
    cuckoos to pay you for what you did." Saying this, he swung the
    sack across his shoulder and went off without even casting a
    glance at the children.</p>

    <p>Not long afterwards the two sisters went to angle in the
    brook, meaning to catch fish for dinner. As they were drawing
    near the water they perceived something, looking like a large
    grasshopper, springing towards the stream, as if it were going
    in. They hurried up to see what it might be, and found that it
    was the dwarf. "Where are you going?" said Rose-Red. "Surely
    you will not jump into the water?"</p>

    <p>"I'm not such a simpleton as that!" yelled the little man.
    "Don't you see that a wretch of a fish is pulling me in?"</p>

    <p>The dwarf had been sitting angling from the side of the
    stream when, by ill-luck, the wind had entangled his beard in
    his line, and just afterwards a big fish taking the bait, the
    unamiable little fellow had not sufficient strength to pull it
    out; so the fish had the advantage, and was dragging the dwarf
    after it. Certainly he caught at every stalk and spray near
    him, but that did not assist him greatly; he was forced to
    follow all the twistings of the fish, and was perpetually in
    danger of being drawn into the brook.</p>

    <p>The girls arrived just in time. They caught hold of him
    firmly, and endeavoured to untwist his beard from the line, but
    in vain; it was too tightly entangled. There was nothing left
    but again to make use of the scissors; so they were taken out,
    and the tangled portion was cut off.
    <!--page contained image-->
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
       id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span></p>

    <p>When the dwarf noticed what they were about, he exclaimed,
    in a great rage, "Is this how you damage my beard? Not content
    with making it shorter before, you are now making it still
    smaller, and completely spoiling it. I shall not ever dare to
    show my face to my friends. I wish you had missed your way
    before you took this road." Then he fetched a sack of pearls
    that lay among the rushes, and saying not another word, hobbled
    off and disappeared behind a large stone.</p>

    <p>Soon after this it chanced that the poor widow sent her
    children to the town to purchase cotton, needles, ribbon and
    tape. The way to the town ran over a common on which in every
    direction large masses of rocks were scattered about. The
    children's attention was soon attracted to a big bird that
    hovered in the air. They remarked that after circling slowly
    for a time, and gradually getting nearer to the ground, it all
    of a sudden pounced down amongst a mass of rock. Instantly a
    heart-rending cry reached their ears, and, running quickly to
    the place, they saw, with horror, that the eagle had seized
    their former acquaintance, the dwarf, and was just about to
    carry him off. The kind children did not hesitate for an
    instant. They took a firm hold of the little man, they strove
    so stoutly with the eagle for possession of his contemplated
    prey, that, after much rough treatment on both sides, the dwarf
    was left in the hands of his brave little friends, and the
    eagle took to flight.</p>

    <p>As soon as the little man had in some measure recovered from
    his alarm, his small, squeaky, cracked voice was heard saying,
    "Couldn't you have held me more gently? See my little coat; you
    have rent and damaged it in a fine manner, you clumsy,
    officious things!" Then he picked up a sack of jewels, and
    slipped out of sight behind a piece of rock.</p>

    <p>The maidens by this time were quite used to his ungrateful,
    ungracious ways; so they took no notice of it, but went on
    their way, made their purchases, and then were ready to return
    to their happy home.</p>

        ROSE-RED
    </div>

    <p>On their way back, suddenly, once more they ran across their
    dwarf friend.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>

    <p>Upon a clear space he had turned out his sack of jewels, so
    that he could count and admire them, for he had not imagined
    that anybody would at so late an hour be coming across the
    common. The setting sun was shining upon the brilliant stones,
    and their changing hues and sparkling rays caused the children
    to pause to admire them also.</p>

    <p>"What are you gazing at?" cried the dwarf, at the same time
    becoming red with rage; "and what are you standing there for,
    making ugly faces?"</p>

    <p>It is probable that he might have proceeded in the same
    complimentary manner, but suddenly a great growl was heard near
    by them, and a big bear joined the party. Up jumped the dwarf
    in extremest terror, but could not get to his hiding-place, the
    bear was too close to him; so he cried out in very evident
    anguish&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Dear Mr. Bear, forgive me, I pray! I will render to you all
    my treasure. Just see those precious stones lying there! Grant
    me my life! What would you do with such an insignificant little
    fellow? You would not notice me between your teeth. See,
    though, those two children, they would be delicate morsels, and
    are as plump as partridges; I beg of you to take them, good Mr.
    Bear, and let me go."</p>

    <p>But the bear would not be moved by his speeches. He gave the
    ill-disposed creature a blow with his paw, and he lay lifeless
    on the ground. Meanwhile, the maidens were running away, making
    off for home as well as they could; but all of a sudden they
    were stopped by a well-known voice that called out,
    "Snow-White, Rose-Red, stay! Do not fear. I will accompany
    you."</p>

    <p>The bear quickly came towards them, but as he reached their
    side, suddenly the bear-skin slipped to the ground, and there
    before them was standing a handsome man, completely garmented
    in gold, who said, "I am a king's son, who was enchanted by the
    wicked dwarf lying over there. He stole my treasure, and
    compelled me to roam the woods transformed into a big bear
    until his death should set me free. Therefore he has only
    received a well-deserved
    punishment."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"

    <p>Then Rose-Red and Snow-White and the Prince all went back to
    the cottage, and some time afterwards Snow-White married the
    Prince, and Rose-Red, his brother, who shared between them the
    enormous treasure which the dwarf had collected in his
    cave.</p>

    <p>The old mother spent many happy years with her children. The
    two rose-trees she took with her when she left the cottage, and
    they grew in front of her window, where they continued to bear

    <h2>THE SLEEPING BEAUTY</h2>

    <p>Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who had no
    children; and this they lamented very much. But one day, as the
    queen was walking by the side of the river, a little fish
    lifted its head out of the water, and said, "Your wish shall be
    fulfilled, and you shall soon have a daughter."</p>

    <p>What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the
    Queen had a little girl who was so very beautiful that the king
    could not cease looking on her for joy, and determined to hold
    a great feast. So he invited not only his relations, friends,
    and neighbours, but also all the fairies, that they might be
    kind and good to his little daughter. Now there were thirteen
    fairies in his kingdom, and he had only twelve golden dishes
    for them to eat out of, so that he was obliged to leave one of
    the fairies without an invitation. The rest came, and after the
    feast was over they gave all their best gifts to the little
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> princess; one gave her
       virtue, another beauty, another riches, and so on till she
       had all that was excellent in the world. When eleven had
       done blessing her, the thirteenth, who had not been invited,
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"
       id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span> and was very angry on that
       account, came in, and determined to take her revenge. So she
       cried out, "The King's daughter shall in her fifteenth year
       be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead." Then the
       twelfth, who had not yet given her gift, came forward and
       said that the bad wish must be fulfilled, but that she could
       soften it, and that the king's daughter should not die, but
       fall asleep for a hundred years.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:80%;">
        <img width="420"
             src="images/080.png"
             alt="The angry fairy" />
    </div>

    <p>But the king hoped to save his dear child from the
    threatened evil, and ordered that all the spindles in the
    kingdom should be bought up and destroyed. All the fairies'
    gifts were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so
    beautiful, and well-behaved, and amiable, and wise, that
    everyone who knew her loved her. Now it happened that on the
    very day she was fifteen years old the king and queen were not
    at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she roved
    about by herself, and poked at all the rooms and chambers, till
    at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow
    staircase ending with a little door. In the door there was a
    golden key, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and
    there sat an old lady spinning away very busily.</p>

    <p>"Why, how now, good mother," said the princess, "what are
    you doing there?"</p>

    <p>"Spinning," said the old lady, and nodded her head.</p>

    <p>"How prettily that little thing turns round!" said the
    princess, and took the spindle and began to spin. But scarcely
    had she touched it before the prophecy was fulfilled, and she
    fell down, as if lifeless, on the ground.</p>

    <p>However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep
    sleep; and the king and queen, who just then came home, and all
    their court, fell asleep too, and the horses slept in the
    stables, and the dogs in the court, the pigeons on the
    house-top, and the flies on the walls. Even the fire on the
    hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; and the meat that
    was roasting stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment
    pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the
    ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell
    asleep; and so everything stood still, and slept
    soundly.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
       id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>

    <div class="figcenter"

             alt="Thorn hedge" />
    </div>

    <p>A large hedge of thorns soon grew around the palace, and
    every year it became higher and thicker, till at last the whole
    place was surrounded and hidden, so that not even the roof or
    the chimneys could be seen. But there went a report, through
    all the land, of the beautiful sleeping Briar Rose (for so was
    the king's daughter called) so that from time to time several
    kings' sons came, and tried to break through the thicket into
    the palace. This they could never do; for the thorns and bushes
    laid hold of them as it were with hands, and there they stuck
    fast and died
    miserably.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"

        DREW."
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>

    <p>After many years came yet another king's son into that land,
    and an old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns, and
    how a beautiful palace stood behind it, in which was a wondrous
    princess, called Briar Rose, asleep with all her court. He
    told, too, how he had heard from his grandfather that many,
    many princes had come, and had tried to break through the
    thicket, but had stuck fast and died.</p>

    <p>Then the young prince said, "All this shall not frighten me;
    I will go and see Briar Rose." The old man tried to dissuade
    him, but he persisted in going.</p>

    <p>Now that very day were the hundred years completed; and as
    the prince came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful
    flowering shrubs, through which he passed with ease, and they
    closed after him, as firm as ever. Then he came at last to the
    palace, and there in the court lay the dogs asleep, and the
    horses in the stables, and on the roof sat the pigeons fast
    asleep with their heads under their wings; and when he came
    into the palace, the flies slept on the walls, and the cook in
    the kitchen was still holding up her hand as if she would beat
    the boy, and the maid with her pail in her hand was going
    a-milking.</p>

    <p>Then he went on still further, and all was so quiet that he
    could hear every breath he drew; till at last he came to the
    old tower and opened the door of the little room in which Briar
    Rose was, and there she lay fast asleep, and looked so
    beautiful that he could not turn his eyes away, and he stooped
    down and gave her a kiss. But the moment he kissed her she
    opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him. For the spell
    was broken.</p>

    <p>Then they went out together, and presently the king and
    queen also awoke, and all the court, and they gazed on each
    other with great wonder. And the horses got up and shook
    themselves, and the dogs jumped about and barked; the pigeons
    took their heads from under their wings, and looked around and
    flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed; the fire
    in the kitchen blazed up and cooked the dinner, and the roast
    meat turned round again; the cook gave the boy the box on his
    ear so that he cried out, and the maid went to milk the cows.
    And then was the wedding of the prince and Briar Rose
    celebrated, and they lived happily together all their lives
    long.</p>

    <p>There was once a king who was such an honourable man that
    his subjects called him "The Good King."</p>

    <p>One day while he was out hunting, a little rabbit that his
    dogs were about to kill, threw itself into his arms. The King
    caressed the little creature, and said:</p>

    <p>"As you have put yourself under my protection nobody shall
    harm you," and he carried the rabbit to his palace, and ordered
    a pretty little hutch to be made for it.</p>

    <p>That night when he was alone in his room, there appeared a
    lovely lady. She wore a robe as white as snow, and a wreath of
    white roses on her head. She addressed him thus:</p>

    <p>"I am the Fairy Candide; I wished to see if you were as good
    as everybody declares you are, and for this reason I changed
    myself into the little rabbit, and ran to you in my distress,
    for I know that those who have pity for dumb creatures have
    still more pity for mankind. I have come to thank you for what
    you did and to say that I shall always be your friend, and will
    grant any request you would now like to make."</p>

    <p>"Madam," replied the King, "I have one only son whom I love
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"

       Chéri; if you have any good will for me, be a friend to my

    <p>"Willingly," responded the Fairy, "I will make your son the
    most handsome prince in the world, or the richest, or the most
    powerful; choose which you will for him."</p>

    <p>"I desire none of these things," replied the King, "but I
    shall be very much obliged if you will make him the best of all
    princes, for what good would it do to him to be handsome, rich,
    or powerful if he were wicked? You know he would be unhappy,
    for it is only goodness which brings content."</p>

    <p>"You are right," answered the Fairy, "but that I cannot do;
    Prince Chéri must himself strive to become good. All that I can
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> promise is that I will give
       him good advice, and punish him for his faults, if he will
       not himself correct them."</p>

    <p>And with this the father had to rest content.</p>

    <p>Not long afterwards the good King died, and two days later
    the Fairy appeared to Prince Chéri.</p>

    <p>"I promised your father to be your friend," she told him;
    "here is a little gold ring, take care of it, for it is worth
    more than diamonds. Every time that you are about to do any
    wrong action it will prick you. If, in spite of the pricks, you
    continue your bad actions, you will lose my friendship and I
    shall become your enemy."</p>

    <p>Saying this the Fairy vanished, leaving the Prince very much
    astonished.</p>

    <p>For some time Chéri behaved so well that the ring did not
    prick at all, but one day when he returned from the chase,
    having caught nothing, he felt so ill-humoured, that when his
    dog Bibi came fawning upon him, he kicked the poor, faithful
    creature from him. At that moment the ring pricked like a pin
    running into his finger.</p>

    <p>"What is this?" he exclaimed: "the Fairy must be mocking me,
    surely I've done no great harm in kicking an animal that
    annoyed me. What's the use of being ruler of a great empire if
    I may not treat my dog as I will?"</p>

    <p>"I am not mocking you," he heard in reply to his thoughts;
    "you have been bad tempered, and you have behaved unkindly to a
    poor animal who did not deserve such treatment. I know you are
    higher than a dog, but the advantage of being ruler of a great
    empire is not in doing all the harm one wishes, but in doing
    all the good one can."</p>

    <p>Chéri promised to be better, but he did not keep his word,
    and so the ring often pricked him, sometimes until his finger
    bled, and at last, in anger, he threw it away.</p>

    <p>Now he thought he would be truly happy, and he gave way to
    any foolish fancies and wrong wishes that came into his head,
    until he really became very wicked and was disliked by
    everyone.</p>

    <p>One day when he was out walking he saw a girl named Zélie,
    who was so beautiful that he resolved to marry
    her.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>

    <p>But Zélie was as good as she was beautiful, and said to
    him:</p>

    <p>"Sir, I am only a shepherdess and have no fortune, but, in
    spite of that, I will never marry you, for although I should be
    a Queen, and you are handsome and rich, your evil behaviour
    would make me hate you."</p>

    <p>Upon this, Chéri flew into a passion, and ordered his
    officers to carry Zélie to the Palace, but she was not used
    unkindly there, for the Prince loved her.</p>

    <p>However, after a while, urged by his foster-brother, a bad
    man who encouraged Chéri in his wickedness, the young man
    rushed in a rage to the room in which Zélie was confined,
    determined that, if she still refused to marry him, the very
    next day she should be sold as a slave.</p>

    <p>Great was his surprise, on entering the apartment, to find
    the captive had disappeared, for he carried the key of the door
    in his pocket.</p>

        <p><i>Painted by Jennie Harbour</i></p>ZÉLIE AND THE FAIRY
        CANDIDE "PRINCE CHÉRI"
    </div>

    <p>Amongst those at the Royal Court was a Councillor named
    Suliman, a man of a noble mind, who had often dared to tell the
    Prince of his faults, and had at first been thanked for this,
    but later on Chéri grew angry that anyone should presume to
    blame him while all others at the Court were full of flattery
    and praise, but in his heart of hearts the Prince respected
    this good man, and this the wicked flatterers knew full well,
    and therefore feared lest he should come into the Prince's
    favour.</p>

    <p>So now they falsely said, that it was Suliman who had helped
    Zélie to escape, and beyond himself with fury, Chéri commanded
    his foster-brother to send soldiers to bring Suliman to him in
    chains, like a criminal.</p>

    <p>After giving these orders Chéri retired to his chamber, but
    scarcely had he entered, when the earth trembled, there came a
    great clap of thunder, and the Fairy Candide appeared before
    him.</p>

    <p>"I promised your father," said she in a stern voice, "to
    give you good advice, and to punish you if you refused to
    follow it. You have despised my counsels and your crimes have
    converted you into a monster, the horror of heaven and earth.
    Now it is time to fulfill my
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> promise of punishment. I
       condemn you to take the resemblance of the beasts you are
       like in disposition&mdash;A lion, because of your
       fury&mdash;a wolf, on account of your greediness&mdash;a
       serpent, for destroying him who has been your second
       father&mdash;a bull, by reason of your brutality."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:60%;">
        <img width="275"
             src="images/089.png"
             alt="Zelie" />
    </div>

    <p>Hardly had the Fairy pronounced these words, when Chéri
    perceived with horror that his body had been transformed.</p>

    <p>He had a lion's head, a bull's horns, the feet of a wolf,
    and the tail of a viper. At the same moment he found himself in
    a forest, and there, after roaming about miserably for some
    time, he fell into a pit dug by hunters. He was captured and
    led into the capital of his Kingdom.</p>

    <p>On the way thither instead of acknowledging that he had
    brought this evil plight upon himself, he bit at his chains,
    and cursed the Fairy. As he was nearing the city great
    rejoicings were seen on every side, and, on the hunters
    enquiring the reason, they were told that Prince Chéri, whose
    only pleasure it was to torment his people, had been crushed to
    death <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
       id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> in his chamber by a
       thunder-bolt, a just punishment for his offences. Four of
       his wicked companions had tried to partition the Kingdom
       between them, but the people would have none such to rule,
       and they had offered the crown to the good and wise Suliman.
       Chéri panted with rage on hearing this, and in the Palace
       Square he saw Suliman on a superb throne, and all the people
       who shouted with joy, and wished him a long life to repair
       the evil brought about by their former sovereign. "I accept
       the throne," said Suliman, "but it is to preserve it for
       Prince Chéri. A fairy has revealed to me that he is not
       dead, and possibly will return to you as virtuous as in his
       earliest years. Alas!" cried Suliman, bursting into tears,
       "his flatterers have ruined him, I know that at heart he is
       good." These words moved Chéri to sorrow for his crimes, and
       he felt that he had not been punished as severely as he
       deserved, and he now resolved to amend his faults.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">

             src="images/090.png"
             alt="Abduction" />
    </div>

    <p>Therefore he obeyed the man who had charge over him, and who
    constantly cruelly beat him, and one day when this keeper lay
    asleep, and a tiger who had broken loose was about to devour
    him, Chéri fought the fierce beast, and saved the man's
    life.</p>

    <p>Then a voice was heard saying, "a good action shall be
    <!--page contained image-->
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> rewarded!" and, to Chéri's
       joy he was instantaneously transformed into a pretty little
       dog which the keeper carried to the Queen.</p>

    <p>The Queen was delighted with him, but, for fear he should
    grow bigger, she gave him only small pieces of bread to eat, so
    that poor Chéri nearly died of hunger.</p>

    <p>One day he carried his little piece of bread into the garden
    to eat it there, but wandering with it in his mouth, still
    further on, he saw a young girl pale and thin, and almost
    fainting for want of food.</p>

    <p>"I am hungry," thought Chéri, "but if I give my breakfast to
    this poor thing, perhaps I shall save her life." He placed his
    bread in the girl's hand, and she ate it hungrily. Just then he
    heard loud cries, and saw that it was the beautiful Zélie
    struggling to free herself from four men who were carrying her
    into a house near by.</p>

    <p>Chéri, longing to help her, followed them barking, and
    although the men kicked him savagely, he would not leave the
    place. Presently from a window was thrown a plateful of
    tempting-looking food. Chéri was just about to devour it, when
    the girl to whom he had given the bread, rushed forward and
    throwing her arms around him cried,</p>

        <br />
         "COME, MY CHILDREN, I AM GOING TO TRANSPORT YOU TO YOUR
        PALACE."
    </div>

    <p>"Poor little dog, do not touch that food, it is poisoned."
    Just then a voice was heard saying, "You see that a good action
    meets with reward," and at the same time Chéri was changed into
    a pretty white pigeon. For several days he flew around hoping
    to catch sight of Zélie, and at last, seated by a hermit,
    outside a cave, he found her. Fluttering down he alighted upon
    her shoulder. Zélie stroked his feathers whispering that she
    now accepted his gift and would love him always, and at that
    moment Chéri regained his natural figure, and Fairy Candide
    appeared in place of the hermit whose form she had taken.
    "Come, my children," said she, "I am going to transport you to
    your Palace, that Chéri may receive his crown of which he has
    now become worthy," and hardly had she ceased speaking, when
    they found themselves in Suliman's presence. The worthy
    Governor was delighted to behold his dear master, and gladly
    resigned the throne to him. Chéri and Zélie reigned long and
    happily, and we are told that the ring, which the Prince now
    wore again, never once severely pricked him.</p><br />

    <h2>THE WHITE CAT</h2>

    <p>There was once a King who had three sons, all handsome and
    brave, but it came to his ears that they wished to reign now
    instead of waiting until he died, he therefore determined to
    divert their minds by making promises the fulfilment of which
    he would always be able to evade. So he called them to his room
    and spoke: "You must agree with me, my dear children, that at
    my great age I cannot manage the business of my kingdom as I
    used to do, and as I am intending retiring into the country, it
    seems to me that a clever, faithful dog would be very good
    company, and I promise you that whichever brings me the most
    beautiful little dog at once succeeds to the kingdom."</p>

    <p>The Princes were much surprised to hear their father's wish
    for a little dog, but agreed with pleasure to go in search of
    one. They said goodbye to the King, who gave them money and
    jewels, announcing that in a year he should expect them to
    return, all on the same day and at the same hour, bringing to
    him their little
    dogs.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"
       id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>

    <div class="figcenter"

         "ON A CERTAIN NIGHT, DURING A STORM OF THUNDER AND RAIN,
        HE LOST HIS WAY."
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"
       id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>

    <p>Then the Princes set out, each by a different road, agreeing
    in a year's time to meet at a certain place a short distance
    from their home.</p>

    <p>The two elder met with many adventures, but it is only the
    youngest that we shall follow.</p>

    <p>This youngest Prince was very courteous, merry, clever and
    accomplished, he was tall, handsome, and all that a prince
    should be.</p>

    <p>Very seldom a day passed without his buying dogs, little
    dogs, big dogs, sporting dogs, spaniels, hounds, dogs of all
    sorts. When he found a beautiful one and then came across a
    still better, he let the first one go, for being
    alone&mdash;the Princes had declined to take any
    attendants&mdash;he could not take charge of thirty or forty
    thousand dogs.</p>

    <p>He travelled on, keeping to one road, until on a certain
    night, during a storm of thunder and rain, he lost his way, and
    after some wandering arrived at a most superb castle where
    nobody was to be seen but about a dozen hands all holding
    torches. Other hands pushed him forwards, and guided him
    through one apartment after another, all so rich in precious
    stones and beautiful paintings, that it was like
    enchantment.</p>

    <p>After passing through sixty rooms, the hands stopped him,
    and here the wet garments of the Prince were taken away, and he
    was clad in raiment of the most exquisite description. The
    hands then conducted him into a banqueting hall, where entered
    a little figure, not two feet high, covered with a long black
    crepe veil, followed by a great procession of cats.</p>

    <p>The Prince was too much astonished to move. The little
    figure approached him, raising the veil, and he saw the most
    beautiful White Cat he had ever beheld.</p>

    <p>Addressing the Prince she said:</p>

    <p>"King's son! welcome! my Feline Majesty sees you with
    pleasure!"</p>

    <p>"Madame Cat," replied the Prince, "it is very good of you to
    receive me thus, but you are not an ordinary cat; being able to
    speak, and possessing this superb castle, are proof of
    that."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
       id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>

    <p>After they had conversed a little while, supper was served
    to them, during which the Prince entertained the Cat by telling
    her all sorts of news, and he discovered that she was well
    informed as to what was taking place in the world.</p>

    <p>Supper over, various cats came in, dressed in fancy
    costumes, and danced a ballet, then the White Cat bid her
    visitor good-night, and the hands which had conducted him
    before, led him to a bed-chamber.</p>

    <p>Early the next morning the hands awoke him, and dressing him
    in a handsome hunting costume, led him to the courtyard, where
    he found the White Cat upon a splendid monkey, with about five
    hundred other cats assembled, all ready for the chase; and
    never had the Prince enjoyed anything so much, for although
    mounted only upon a wooden horse, he rode at a great pace.</p>

    <p>Day after day passed in such delights as made the Prince
    almost forget his own country.</p>

    <p>"Alas!" said he to the White Cat again and again, "how sad I
    shall be to leave you! I love you so dearly! Either become a
    woman, or change me into a cat!"</p>

    <p>A year passes very quickly when one has no care or trouble,
    and is enjoying life. But the White Cat knew when the Prince
    should return home, and reminded him, saying, "Don't you know
    you have only three days to look for the little dog for your
    father, and that your brothers will have found the most
    beautiful?"</p>

    <p>Then the Prince came to himself, and cried, "By what charm
    have you made me forget what is so important? Where shall I
    find the dog, and a horse swift enough for such a journey?" And
    he was in great distress.</p>

    <p>The White Cat comforted him, however, saying that the wooden
    horse would take him to his journey's end sufficiently quickly,
    and that she would herself also provide the little dog; then
    she handed to him a walnut, saying, "Put your ear to this shell
    and you will hear him barking."</p>

    <p>So the Prince met his brothers, and they came into the
    King's presence.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"
       id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <img width="500"
             src="images/097.png"
             alt="Three riders" />
    </div>

    <p>The two elder sons had brought little dogs so delicate and
    small that one hardly dared to touch them, and none could
    decide which should have the kingdom. Then the youngest took
    from his pocket the nut the Cat had given to him, and there was
    seen a little dog so tiny that it could go through a ring
    without touching it; he was also able to dance, and play the
    castanets, while his ears touched the ground. The King was
    embarassed, for it was impossible to find a flaw in this lovely
    little creature.</p>

    <p>However as he did not desire to part with his crown, he
    declared that they had succeeded so well in their first quest
    that now he should like them to search, by land and sea, for a
    piece of linen so fine that it would pass through the eye of a
    very small needle.</p>

    <p>Then the three Princes set out once more, but the youngest
    mounted his wooden horse and repaired at once to the White Cat,
    who was rejoiced to see him, and the second year passed by as
    the first had done.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"
       id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span>

    <p>When the day came round appointed by the King for the return
    of his sons, the two elder appeared before him, and, without
    awaiting the arrival of their brother, displayed their pieces
    of linen, which were of a fineness quite astonishing. But
    although they would pass through the eye of a large needle,
    through the small needle the King had selected they would not
    go.</p>

    <p>There was much murmuring at this, and while the brothers
    were disputing the King's decision, a charming sound was heard
    of trumpets and other musical instruments.</p>

    <p>It was the youngest Prince who arrived in a chariot with
    out-riders and numerous attendants, all of which had been
    provided for him by the White Cat.</p>

    <p>After respectfully greeting his father and embracing his
    brothers, he took out of a jewelled box a nut which he broke.
    On breaking the nut he found a cherry stone, the stone was
    broken and there was the kernel, in the kernel was a grain of
    corn, in the grain of corn a millet seed, and within that a
    piece of linen so fine that it passed six times through the
    smallest needle's eye, and moreover on it were exquisite
    paintings of people and places without number.</p>

    <p>The King heaved a deep sigh, and turning to his children
    said,</p>

    <p>"Nothing pleases me, in my old age, so much as your
    deference to my desires, and I wish to prove you once more.
    Travel for a year, and he who at the end of the year brings
    home the most beautiful girl shall marry her, and be crowned
    king on his marriage. I promise you that I will not defer this
    reward any longer."</p>

    <p>Our Prince saw the injustice of all this; his little dog and
    piece of linen were worth ten kingdoms, not only one; but he
    was too well brought up to go against his father's wishes, and,
    mounting into his chariot, with his retinue, he returned to the
    White Cat's Castle.</p>

    <p>"Well! King's son!" said the White Cat, "you have returned
    once more without your crown?"</p>

    <p>"Madam," answered the Prince, "your gifts should have gained
    it for me, but I am convinced that the King would have more
    pain in giving it up than I should have pleasure in possessing
    it!"</p>

    <p>"Never mind," she replied, "you shall not neglect anything
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"
       id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span> that may deserve it; and if
       you must conduct a beautiful girl to your father's court, I
       will look for one so that you may gain the prize. Meanwhile
       let us be happy."</p>

    <div class="figcenter"

    </div>

    <p>If the Cat had not taken pains to remember the time when he
    must return to the court, the Prince would surely have
    forgotten it. On the evening before, she told him that she
    would bring him to one of the most beautiful Princesses in the
    world, that at last the hour had arrived to destroy the fatal
    work of an evil fairy, and to do this he must make up his mind
    to cut off her head and tail, which he was at once to throw
    into the fire.</p>

    <p>"I," cried the Prince, "Blanchette that I love: do you think
    I <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
       id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> should be cruel enough to
       kill you? No doubt, you wish to prove my heart which will
       certainly never forget what I owe to you for your
       kindness."</p>

    <p>"No! King's son," she continued, "I don't think you are
    ungrateful. Do this that I beseech you, and then we shall begin
    to be happy with one another, by the faith and honour of a cat,
    believe that I am truly your friend."</p>

    <p>Tears flowed from the Prince's eyes even at the thought, and
    he said all that he could to avoid it, but she urged him so
    vehemently that at last he took his sword and tremblingly cut
    off the head and tail of his dear friend the Cat.</p>

    <p>In the same moment took place the most marvellous change
    imaginable.</p>

    <p>The body of the White Cat grew large, and was transformed
    into that of a girl; how, one could not say; one only knew it
    was so. Her figure was majestic, her manners charming, her
    whole appearance beautiful beyond words.</p>

    <p>Then there entered an immense number of lords and ladies,
    who carrying their cats' skins, or with them thrown across
    their shoulders, came and cast themselves at the feet of the
    Queen, expressing their joy at seeing her again in her rightful
    form.</p>

    <p>She received them all with a kindness which showed the
    goodness of her heart, and then turning to the Prince she told
    the story of her life, and how by a wicked enchantment she had
    been transformed into a White Cat.</p>

    <p>"But it is you, my Prince, who have freed me," she
    concluded; "as soon as I saw you I knew my troubles were at an
    end."</p>

    <p>They set out forthwith in a splendid carriage. As they drew
    near the castle, at the place where the three brothers were to
    meet, the Queen entered into a little crystal rock ornamented
    with precious stones, and this was carried by richly dressed
    young men.</p>

    <p>The Prince who had remained in the carriage, saw his
    brothers, approaching with wondrously beautiful ladies.</p>

    <p>On being questioned he told them that all he had brought was
    a little White Cat.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"

    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
       id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>

    <p>They began to laugh at him, and drove on followed by the
    young Prince, while after him was brought the crystal rock.</p>

    <p>Arrived at the Palace the two elder Princes dismounted with
    their marvellous Princesses.</p>

    <p>The King received them graciously, and did not know to which
    to award the prize.</p>

    <p>He looked at his youngest son and said, "This time, then,
    you have come alone." "Your Majesty will see in this rock a
    little White Cat who mews sweetly and has soft little velvet
    paws," answered the Prince.</p>

    <p>The King smiled, and himself went to open the rock. But, as
    he came near, the Queen, with a touch, made it shatter to
    pieces, and from out of it she appeared like the sun that has
    been hidden by clouds; her fair hair was spread over her
    shoulders, and fell in waves to her feet, and she was robed in
    a gown of white and rose-colour.</p>

    <p>She made a deep curtsey to the King who, struck with
    admiration, could not help exclaiming,</p>

    <p>"Here is one who is matchless, and she deserves my
    crown."</p>

    <p>"Sire," she answered, "I have not come to take away the
    throne that you fill with such dignity; I was born heir to six
    kingdoms, allow me to offer you one, and one of them I give to
    each of your sons. In return all I ask of you is this young
    Prince for my husband. We shall still have three kingdoms."</p>

    <p>The King and all the Court uttered loud cries of joy. The
    marriage was at once celebrated, also that of the other two
    Princes; and in such a manner that the Court spent several
    months in fêtes of all sorts.</p>

    <p>Then each one of them departed to govern his kingdom, the
    White Cat making herself ever remembered as much by her
    kindness and generosity as by her rare merit and
    beauty.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"

    <h2>BLUEBEARD</h2>

    <p>In the long ago times, in a splendid house, surrounded by
    fine gardens and a park, there lived a man who had riches in
    abundance, and everything to make him popular except one, and
    that was his beard, for his beard was neither black as a
    raven's wing, golden as the sunlight, nor just an ordinary
    every-day colour, but it was blue, bright
    blue.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
       id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>

    <p>Of course had blue beards come into fashion his would have
    been considered beautiful beyond words, but, as far as we know,
    blue beards have never as yet been fashionable, nor are they
    likely to be so.</p>

    <p>However, in spite of his blue beard this man had married
    several times, though what had become of his wives nobody could
    say.</p>

    <p>Now, not far from Bluebeard's house there dwelt a widow with
    two very lovely daughters, and one of these Bluebeard wished to
    marry, but which he did not mind, they might settle that
    between themselves.</p>

    <p>Neither of these girls had the least desire to have a
    husband with a blue beard, and also, not knowing the fate of
    the other wives, they did not like to risk disappearing from
    the world as those had done, but being very polite young women
    they would not refuse Bluebeard's proposals outright. The
    younger said, "I would not for a moment take away Sister Anne's
    chance of marrying such a wealthy man," while Sister Anne
    declared that, although the elder, she would much prefer to
    give way to her sister. And so it went on for some time.</p>

    <p>Then Bluebeard invited the widow and her daughters to spend
    a week with him, and many of their neighbours he also
    invited.</p>

    <p>Most sumptuous was the entertainment provided for them.
    Hunting and fishing expeditions, picnics and balls went on from
    morning till night, and all the night through, so that there
    was not time even to think of sleep, only feasting and pleasure
    the whole week long.</p>

    <p>So well, indeed, did the younger sister enjoy this, that by
    the end of the week she had begun to think perhaps after all
    her host's beard was not so very blue, and that it would be a
    fine thing to be the mistress of such a magnificent mansion,
    and the wife of such a rich husband.</p>

    <p>And so, not long afterwards, there was a grand wedding, and
    the widow's younger daughter became Mrs. Bluebeard.</p>

    <p>About a month later, Bluebeard told his wife that he must
    leave her for several weeks, having to travel on business.</p>

    <p>"While I am absent, my dear," said he, "invite your
    relations <span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
       id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span> and friends and enjoy
       yourself just as you please in entertaining them. See here
       are my keys, the keys of the rooms and of the chests where I
       keep my money, my gold and silver plate, and my jewels.
       Unlock rooms and chests and use freely what you will."</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <img width="600"
             src="images/105.png"
             alt="Bleubeard gives key to wife" />
    </div>

    <p>"This small key," he added, pointing to quite a little one,
    "is the key of the door at the end of the lower landing, you
    will not need to use this at all. In fact, should you open that
    door, or even put <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> this key into the lock, I
       should be dreadfully angry, indeed I should make you suffer
       for it in a terrible way."</p>

    <p>Then Bluebeard bid his wife good-bye, and departed.</p>

    <p>As soon as Mrs. Bluebeard's friends and relations knew that
    her husband was away, they came flocking to visit her, for they
    longed to see all her splendid possessions, but had feared to
    come before.</p>

    <p>They could not enough admire the magnificent apartments, and
    ran from one to another praising everything they beheld.</p>

    <p>But the young wife heeded nothing they said or did, all she
    thought of was that little key which she must not use,
    wondering more and more why she ought not to open that one
    particular door.</p>

    <p>At last she could bear it no longer, but slipping away from
    her visitors, she ran along the passages and stairs, nearly
    falling down them, so great was her haste, until she came to
    that door at the end of the corridor.</p>

    <p>Not pausing an instant, she thrust the key into the lock,
    and the door sprang open.</p>

    <p>At first she could distinguish nothing, for the room was
    dark and gloomy, but then, all of a sudden, she knew what had
    become of Bluebeard's other wives, for there they lay, in a
    long, straight row, all dead. She stood horrified for a moment
    or two, gazing at the pale faces, and long hair spread out
    around them, then picking up the little key which she had taken
    from the lock but dropped in her fright, she hastily quitted
    the room, shut and locked the door, and ran to her own chamber
    to calm herself before returning to her guests. But she was
    unable to rest for an instant, so dreadful were her feelings;
    then with terror she noticed that on the key there was a stain.
    She wiped it with her handkerchief, but alas! it was blood that
    would not be wiped away. She washed the key and rubbed it, and
    scraped it and polished it, but all to no purpose, if she
    succeeded in cleansing one side, the mark came out on the
    other. For the key was enchanted.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/166.jpg"
             name="fig166s"
             id="fig166s"><img width="482"

             alt="BLUEBEARD" /></a>

        <p><i>Painted by Jennie Harbour</i></p>BLUEBEARD
    </div>

    <p>That same evening Bluebeard returned saying he had met the
    man whom he was wanting to see, and so the long journey was
    unnecessary, and he was rejoiced to be at home again.</p>

    <p>Next morning he called for the keys; his wife brought them
    to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span> him, but not the little
       one; that she left behind. Bluebeard noticed this directly
       and sent her to fetch it. Trembling, and white as a sheet,
       she was forced to give it into his hand.</p>

    <p>"Ha! what is this?" he cried, "what is this stain that I
    see!"</p>

    <p>His poor wife trembled still more, and could not speak.</p>

    <p>"Wretched woman!" shouted Bluebeard, "you have used this
    key, you have unlocked the door of that room at the end of the
    passage. You shall die!!!"</p>

    <p>In vain did his wife plead with him to spare her, kneeling
    before him with tears streaming from her eyes. "You shall die!"
    he cried again, more savagely than before.</p>

    <p>"Let me have a few moments alone, to prepare for death,"</p>

    <p>"Half a quarter of an hour, but not a moment longer," he
    replied, and left her.</p>

    <p>The poor young woman hastened to a room at the foot of the
    turret stairs where was her Sister Anne, and called to her.</p>

    <p>"Sister Anne, Sister Anne, look from the tower window. Can
    you see no one coming?" And Sister Anne, looking out,
    answered:</p>

    <p>"Alas! No! Nothing but the green grass, and the sun which
    shines upon it."</p>

    <p>Bluebeard shouted from below that the time was almost
    up.</p>

    <p>"Sister Anne, Sister Anne, look once again, can you see no
    one coming?" whispered the young wife wringing her hands. Her
    brothers, she knew, were to visit her that day&mdash;if only
    they would come in time!</p>

    <p>"Alas, No!" Sister Anne replied. "I see a cloud of dust, but
    it is only a flock of sheep on the road."</p>

    <p>But now Bluebeard bawled out so loudly for his wife to come
    down, that the whole house shook.</p>

    <p>"Sister Anne, Sister Anne, tell me is no one coming?"</p>

    <p>"I see two horsemen afar off," cried Sister Anne. "I will
    beckon to them to hasten hither."</p>

    <p>But Bluebeard would wait not a moment longer, and nearly
    dead with terror his wife descended, still entreating him to
    spare her life.</p>

    <p>He would not, however, give heed to her prayers, and was
    just <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
       id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span> brandishing his sword, so
       that it might come down straight and true upon her slender
       neck, when the door burst open and two young army officers
       came rushing in, whom Bluebeard recognised as the brothers
       of his wife. He swiftly fled, but they speedily followed,
       and for his many crimes slew him then and there.</p>

    <p>All his wealth now belonged to his widow, and she gratefully
    rewarded her brothers by purchasing them commissions in the
    army; she settled a large sum of money upon her sister, and
    after a while she married again, and with a good husband lived
    a happy life.</p>

    <h2>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</h2>

    <p>Once upon a time, a long while ago, there was a Beast.</p>

    <p>He was a Great Beast, and lived in a Great Castle that stood
    in the middle of a Great Park, and everybody in the country
    held the Beast in great fear. In fact everything about the
    Beast was great; his roar was great and terrific and could be
    heard for miles around the park, and when he roared the people
    trembled.</p>

    <p>Nobody ever saw the Beast, which was by no means remarkable,
    for the Beast never came out of his Park, and no one, I can
    assure you, ever ventured on to his estate.</p>

    <p>But matters were not allowed to remain like this for ever,
    for <span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
       id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span> something very wonderful
       happened to the Beast and to somebody else, and if that
       something had not happened this story would never have been
       written.</p>

    <p>About two miles and three quarters from the Castle gates
    there lived a rich merchant and his three daughters. The two
    elder girls were ugly disagreeable things, and although they
    had all they could wish for to make them happy they were always
    grumbling; but the youngest daughter, whose name was Beauty,
    was very pretty, and her nature was happy and good, her
    presence was sunshine, and she was the joy of her father's
    heart.</p>

    <p>Well, one day the two elder sisters had something to grumble
    about with a vengeance, for a telegram arrived to say that the
    merchant was no longer a rich merchant, for he had lost all his
    money.</p>

    <p>So the horses and carriages had to be sold, and everything
    that was of value was got rid of, the servants were sent away,
    and the merchant and his daughters had to do their own
    work.</p>

    <p>Dear me, it was shocking, the way those two sisters
    grumbled, but Beauty, oh dear no, she was all smiles, for her
    heart was as sunny as ever, as she rolled up the sleeves of her
    print frock, and cooked the dinner, and scrubbed the floors,
    and made herself useful, here, there, and everywhere.</p>

    <p>Things had been going on like this for about three months,
    when one fine morning another telegram boy came with another
    telegram to say that somebody who owed the merchant a great
    deal of money was ready to pay the debt, and all the merchant
    had to do was to go to the city and get it.</p>

    <p>Of course, everybody was delighted at this good news, and
    the merchant didn't waste any time, but started off to the city
    at once.</p>

    <p>"Mind you bring me something back," said the eldest daughter
    as he was starting.</p>

    <p>"What shall it be?" asked the merchant.</p>

    <p>"A white satin dress trimmed with lace and pearls," said his
    eldest daughter.</p>

    <p>"And you must bring me something too, please, father," said
    the second daughter.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"
       id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>

    <p>"And what do you want," asked the merchant.</p>

    <p>"A purse full of gold so that I can buy what I want myself,"
    said the second daughter.</p>

    <p>"I will try and do what you both ask," he said, "and what
    shall I bring for my Beauty?"</p>

    <p>"I will wait a little for my dresses and things," replied
    the smiling Beauty, as she helped her father on with his cloak,
    "but I should like you to bring me home a rose, a lovely red
    rose, if you can."</p>

    <p>So her father kissed her, and promised he would bring her
    the rose, and went on his way full of hopes.</p>

    <p>What a pity it is that our hopes cannot be always realized,
    and that we are so often doomed to disappointment! When the
    merchant arrived at the city, to his dismay he found that the
    man who owed him the money was still unable to pay him, the man
    had been disappointed himself at the last moment.</p>

    <p>So the unhappy father had to return home without the white
    satin dress trimmed with lace and pearls, and without the bag
    of money, and he dreaded meeting his two daughters, for he knew
    they would be terribly angry.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:75%;">
        <img width="400"
             src="images/111.png"
             alt="Beauty and father" />
    </div>

    <p>Now on his way home from the station to his house he had to
    pass by part of the wall that surrounded the Great Park where
    the Great Beast lived in his Great
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
       id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span> Castle; and as he passed by
       a corner of the wall what should he see hanging just over
       the top, and just within his reach if he stood on his toes,
       but a lovely red rose.</p>

    <p>"At any rate I can take my Beauty what she asked for," he
    said to himself, and, without so much as giving a thought to
    the wrong he was doing, he stood on his toes and plucked the
    rose.</p>

    <p>He was sorry he did it.</p>

    <p>Of a sudden there was a roar, such a roar that the very
    ground shook, and as to the poor merchant he quivered like a
    leaf.</p>

    <p>Enough to make him quiver indeed, for a gate in the wall
    suddenly opened, and out rushed the <i>Beast</i>.</p>

    <p>Yes, the Beast, if you please, and he seized the merchant by
    the scruff of his neck, and dragged him into the Park, and shut
    the gate after him.</p>

    <p>"Don't you know it's a sin to steal?" roared the Beast. "How
    dare you steal my roses? I am going to kill you."</p>

    <p>"Oh, mercy, Mr. Beast," cried the unhappy man, flinging
    himself on his knees before the monster.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:50%;">
        <img width="400"
             src="images/112.png"
             alt="Frowning women" />
    </div>

    <p>"I'm going to kill you," roared the Beast still more loudly.
    "It's taken years to cultivate this sort of rose, and&mdash;and
    I'm going to kill you. Unless," he added after a pause, "you
    send me one of your daughters here instead."</p>

    <p>"All right," said the merchant and got on his feet
    again.</p>

    <p>"She must be here to-morrow by breakfast time, and I
    breakfast <!--blank page-->
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"
       id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span> early," said the Beast, as
       he let the merchant out of the gate. "If she is not here, I
       shall come for you, and don't you forget it."</p>

    <p>It was by no means likely that he would forget it, in fact
    he could think of nothing else. He hurried home and told his
    dreadful news, and received a dreadful scolding from his two
    elder daughters, who were angry at not getting their
    presents.</p>

    <p>"And it is Beauty's fault that you have got into this
    trouble," they said. "Beauty and her stupid rose. Beauty had
    better get you out of the trouble." Beauty said little, but
    smiled on, with sunshine in her heart, and trust in her loving
    nature, and cooked the dinner.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"

         "WHEN SHE CAME TO THE GATE IN THE WALL<br />

    </div>

    <p>Early next morning when the dawn was breaking she left her
    father's house, leaving a little note behind her begging him
    not to be anxious but that she had gone to the Beast's
    castle.</p>

    <p>When she came to the gate in the wall she knocked upon it
    three times and it opened as if by magic, for she could see no
    one. And she stepped into the garden of red roses, and in the
    distance across the Park she saw the Castle, and she thought
    she had never seen anything so beautiful. For it was built of
    mother-of-pearl, and the red and yellow gleams of the rising
    sun shone upon its glistening walls, and lit them up with a
    thousand radiant lights.</p>

    <p>Beauty marvelled at the loveliness and walked on. And when
    she arrived at this beautiful Castle, the huge gates opened as
    if by magic, and the doors opened as if by magic, for never a
    soul did she see, nor living thing of any sort.</p>

    <p>And in the great hall was the breakfast table laid for two.
    It was a nice breakfast with steaming hot dishes, and jams,
    honey, and hot rolls, and brightly polished silver, and sweet
    flowers.</p>

    <p>Then the Beast appeared suddenly from behind a curtain; oh,
    he was an awful Beast, and Beauty's heart beat fast! But he
    seemed a polite Beast for all that.</p>

    <p>He handed Beauty a chair, and when she had sat down
    said:</p>

    <p>"I bid you welcome; which do you take, tea or coffee?"</p>

    <p>"Tea please," answered Beauty.</p>

    <p>"Then pour it out," he said, "and I'll take tea too, please.
    Eggs, do you like eggs hard or
    soft?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"
       id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>

    <p>"I always cook mine three minutes and a half," replied
    Beauty.</p>

    <p>"Half a minute too much, I think. But you shall have just
    what you like."</p>

    <p>And so she had; not only at the breakfast table but in
    everything. She had only to express a wish and it was
    immediately gratified. She had ponies to ride, and dogs and
    cats, and pet birds, and the most beautiful dresses ever worn
    by real princesses.</p>

    <p>And if it had not been that she was away from her father she
    would really have been happy.</p>

        <p><i>Painted by Jennie Harbour</i></p>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
    </div>

    <p>The Beast was most kind and attentive to her, and told her
    that he loved her, and three times a day he asked her to marry
    him, but Beauty shook her head and said, oh no, she
    couldn't.</p>

    <p>Well, Beauty had been at the great Castle some time when she
    began to pine to go home and see her father, and she begged the
    Beast to let her go.</p>

    <p>"Very good," he said with a great sigh, "you may go home
    to-day, but promise me that you will be back early to-morrow
    morning. If you do not come back early I am sure I shall die
    for I love you so dearly."</p>

    <p>So Beauty promised and went home, and she took presents for
    her father and her sisters, and when the sisters heard of all
    the wonderful things at the great Castle, they were envious and
    jealous, and made up their minds to do Beauty and the Beast a
    great injury.</p>

    <p>So they mixed something in Beauty's supper that made her
    sleep nearly all the next day, and so she did not keep her
    promise. It was evening when she arrived at the gate in the
    wall, instead of early morning.</p>

    <p>But she knocked three times and the gate opened by magic,
    and she went through the garden and hurried to the Castle, that
    shone like fire in the light of the setting sun. And the huge
    gates opened by magic, and the doors opened by magic, and she
    stood in the great hall, but there was no Beast there. She
    searched in all the rooms but he was not there; with fear and
    anxiety in her heart she ran into the gardens, and there she
    found him at last. Found him lying stretched out on the grass,
    and she thought he was
    dead.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
       id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>

    <p>"Oh, dear darling Beast," she cried, as she threw herself on
    her knees beside him, and raised his ugly head, "dear Beast, do
    not die, for I love you with all my heart, and will marry you
    to-morrow." And she kissed him. Then of a sudden he sprang to
    his feet, but no longer the Beast, no longer a hideous monster,
    but a beautiful prince most beautifully dressed. "Dearest," he
    said, "a wicked fairy turned me into this brute form until a
    day should come when a good girl like you should tell me that
    she loved me. And you will marry me to-morrow."</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes," answered Beauty, "but the wicked fairy could not
    change your nature. I would have married you if you had
    remained just as you were."</p>

    <p>And so they married and lived happy ever afterwards, and
    they took care of Beauty's father until the end of his days; so
    he was happy, and they forgave the two sisters and gave them
    fine dresses and jewels, and the two sisters turned over a new
    leaf and were less selfish, and they were happy, so this is a
    very happy ending to the story.</p>

    <h2>TUFTY RIQUET</h2>

    <p>There was once upon a time a Queen who had the ugliest
    little baby imaginable, so ugly, indeed, that it was almost
    impossible to believe he was a little boy at all.</p>

    <p>A fairy, however, assured his mother that the little baby
    would be very good and clever, saying that she was also giving
    him a gift which would enable him to make that person whom he
    loved the best as clever as
    himself.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
       id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span>

    <p>This somewhat consoled the Queen, but still she was very
    unhappy because her son was so ugly, though no sooner had he
    begun to speak than he could talk about all sorts of things,
    and he had such pretty ways that people were charmed with
    him.</p>

    <p>I forgot to say, that, when he was quite a baby, he had a
    funny little tuft of hair on his head, so he was called Tufty
    Riquet, for Riquet was the family name.</p>

    <p>When Riquet was about seven years old, the Queen of a
    kingdom near by was given two baby daughters, twins, of which
    one was so exquisitely beautiful that the Queen nearly died of
    joy when she saw her, and so the fairy, the same one who had
    given Riquet his gift of cleverness, to keep the Queen from
    making herself ill with excitement, told her that this little
    Princess would not be at all clever, indeed she would be as
    stupid as she was beautiful.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:65%;">
        <img width="400"
             src="images/118.png"
             alt="The queen" />
    </div>

    <p>The Queen was very much grieved at this, and felt still more
    troubled when she beheld her other daughter, for the second
    Princess was extremely ugly.</p>

    <p>"Do not take it too much to heart, madam," remarked the
    fairy, "for this second daughter will be so clever that it will
    scarcely be noticed that she is not beautiful."</p>

    <p>"Well, if it must be so, it must," remarked the Queen, "but
    I should certainly have liked the elder one, who is beautiful,
    to be just a little bit clever too."</p>

    <p>"I can do nothing as to her mind,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
       id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> madam," replied the fairy,
       "but for her beauty I can, and as there is nothing I would
       not do to please you, I will give her a gift so that she can
       make the one who wins her heart beautiful too."</p>

    <p>As the Princesses grew up, their gifts likewise grew with
    them, so that everybody spoke about the beauty of the one and
    the cleverness of the other; but also their defects grew, so
    that it could not but be noticed that the younger was daily
    uglier, and the elder day by day became more stupid, until she
    either said nothing in reply to a question, or something quite
    silly, and so clumsy was she that she could not arrange four
    china ornaments on the chimney piece without breaking one, or
    drink a glass of water without spilling half of it on her
    frock.</p>

    <p>Although it is a great thing to have beauty, yet the younger
    generally received more attention in company than her elder
    sister.</p>

    <p>At first, everybody would gather around the beautiful one
    admiringly, but before long they would leave her for the clever
    Princess, to listen to her pleasant conversation; and by the
    end of a quarter of an hour the elder would be left alone,
    while the other would be the centre of a group.</p>

    <p>This the elder sister noticed, in spite of her stupidity,
    and she would gladly have given all her beauty for half the
    cleverness of her sister, and sometimes the Queen, although
    full of kindness, would reproach her daughter for her
    foolishness, which caused the Princess almost to die of
    grief.</p>

    <p>One day when she had retreated to a wood to brood over her
    unhappiness, she saw a little man coming towards her. He was
    uncommonly ugly and unpleasing in appearance, but was very
    richly dressed.</p>

    <p>It was the young Prince Tufty Riquet, who had fallen in love
    with the pictures he had seen of her, and had left his father's
    kingdom for the sake of making her acquaintance.</p>

    <p>Delighted to meet her alone in this manner, he accosted her
    as courteously as possible, but soon, noticing that she was
    melancholy, he said:</p>

    <p>"I cannot understand how it is that anyone as beautiful as
    you <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> are, can be as sad as you
       appear to be; for I must own, that although I can boast of
       having seen many beauties, not one have I ever met whose
       beauty equalled yours."</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:80%;">
        <img width="400"
             src="images/120.png"
             alt="Princess" />
    </div>

    <p>"It pleases you to say so, sir," replied the Princess, and
    relapsed into silence.</p>

    <p>"Beauty," went on Riquet, "is so delightful that one would
    give everything for it, and if anyone is beautiful I can't
    understand anything troubling
    greatly."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
       id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>

    <p>"I would rather be as ugly as you," answered the Princess,
    "and be clever, than as beautiful as I am, and be stupid."</p>

    <p>"To think you are stupid is a sure sign that you have a
    certain amount of cleverness, madam," replied Riquet.</p>

    <p>"I don't think about that," said the Princess, "but I am
    quite sure that I am very silly, and the grief of that is
    killing me."</p>

    <p>"If that is all that troubles you, I can soon put an end to
    your grief," said Riquet, "for I have the power of giving
    cleverness to the person whom I love the best, and if only you
    will marry me, you shall become as clever as you can wish."</p>

    <p>The Princess was greatly astonished, but remained
    silent.</p>

    <p>"I can see," continued Riquet, "that this proposal is not to
    your taste, and I am not astonished. I will give you a year to
    think about it."</p>

    <p>So great was the longing of the Princess to be clever, that
    she at once promised Riquet to marry him in a year's time, and
    no sooner had she made the promise than a great change took
    place in her, and she found she could say all sorts of pleasant
    things, on all sorts of subjects, in quite an easy manner.</p>

    <p>She at once began a conversation with Riquet, making such
    brilliant remarks, that he could almost think he had given her
    all his cleverness and had kept none for himself.</p>

    <p>When the Princess returned to the Palace, everybody was
    astonished at the sudden and extraordinary change, for, instead
    of saying stupid things, or just nothing at all, she was now
    full of beautiful ideas which she expressed most
    charmingly.</p>

    <p>The report of this transformation was soon spread abroad,
    and all the young Princes of the neighbouring kingdoms asked
    for her hand in marriage, but not one did she find altogether
    suitable.</p>

    <p>However, at last one arrived, who was so powerful, rich,
    clever and handsome, that she could not help approving of him,
    and her father, noticing this, told her she was quite free to
    choose what husband she wished.</p>

    <p>The Princess thanked him, and asked for time to consider the
    matter.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"
       id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>

    <div class="figleft"

             src="images/122.png"
             alt="Tufty Riquet" />
    </div>

    <p>Then, to think it over, she went by chance, into the wood
    where she had met Tufty Riquet.</p>

    <p>While she was walking, deep in thought, she noticed a loud
    noise beneath her feet, as of many persons hastening to and
    fro; then, listening attentively, she heard a voice say, "Bring
    me the saucepan," and another voice cry, "Put some wood on the
    fire."</p>

    <p>At the same moment the earth opened and she saw a big
    kitchen full of cooks, and all sorts of things necessary for
    the making of a magnificent banquet, and everybody hard at
    work.</p>

    <p>The Princess, astonished at this sight, asked the men for
    whom they were working.</p>

    <p>"For the Prince Tufty Riquet," answered the head cook, "for
    to-morrow is his wedding day."</p>

    <p>The Princess, more surprised than ever, all at once
    recollected that it was just a year ago that very day that she
    had promised to marry the ugly Tufty
    Riquet.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"

    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
       id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span>

    <p>The reason that she had not remembered her promise before
    was that she was foolish when she made it, and in becoming
    clever she had forgotten all her former stupidities.</p>

    <p>She had only walked on a few steps further, when Riquet
    appeared before her, magnificently clad, as a Prince about to
    marry.</p>

    <p>"Here you see me, madam," said he, "keeping my word, and I
    have no doubt that you also came here to keep yours, and by
    giving me your hand to make me the happiest of men."</p>

    <p>"I frankly confess," replied the Princess, "that I have not
    yet made up my mind, and I do not think I can ever do as you
    wish."</p>

    <p>"You surprise me, madam," said Riquet.</p>

    <p>"I can quite believe that," said the Princess, "and if you
    were not a good and clever man, I should not know how to act.
    But you are well aware that it was when I was stupid I promised
    to marry you, but now, as you may imagine, I am not so easily
    pleased."</p>

    <p>"Except for my ugliness," said Riquet, "have you anything
    against me? Do you object to my birth, my character, or my
    manners?"</p>

    <p>"Not at all," replied the Princess, "I love those things in
    you."</p>

    <p>"If that is so," answered Riquet, "I shall indeed be made
    happy, because you can cause me to become the most delightful
    of men if only you will desire it. For know, madam, the same
    fairy who at my birth gave me the power to impart cleverness to
    whomsoever I should love, gave you a gift also, that of being
    able to render beautiful the one to whom you would grant this
    favour."</p>

    <p>"If that is the case," exclaimed the Princess, "I desire
    with all my heart that you might be the most handsome and
    pleasing Prince in the world."</p>

    <p>No sooner had the Princess uttered these words than her wish
    was fulfilled, though some say that no change really took place
    in Riquet, but that the Princess loved him now so much that all
    his ugliness was seen as beauty by her eyes.</p>

    <p>However that may be, she straightway consented to be his
    bride, and, as the preparations had already been made, the
    wedding took place the very next day.</p>

    <h2>THUMBLING</h2>

    <p>There was once a poor woodman sitting by the fire in his
    cottage and his wife sat by his side spinning. "How lonely it
    is," said he, "for you and me to sit here by ourselves without
    any children to play about and amuse us, while other people
    seem so happy and merry with their children!" "What you say is
    very true," said the wife, sighing, and turning her wheel; "how
    happy should I be if I had but one child! and if it were ever
    so small, nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb, I should be
    very happy, and love it dearly." Now it came to pass that this
    good woman's wish was fulfilled just as she desired; for, some
    time afterwards, she had a little boy, who was quite healthy
    and strong, but not much bigger than my thumb.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"
       id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> So they said, "Well, we
       cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little
       as he is, we will love him dearly;" and they called him
       Thumbling.</p>

    <p>They gave him plenty of food, yet he never grew bigger, but
    remained just the same size as when he was born; still, his
    eyes were sharp and sparkling and he soon showed himself to be
    a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.
    One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood
    to cut fuel, he said, "I wish I had some one to bring the cart
    after me, for I want to make haste." "Oh, father!" cried
    Thumbling, "I will take care of that; the cart shall be in the
    wood by the time you want it." Then the woodman laughed and
    said, "How can that be? You cannot reach up to the horse's
    bridle." "Never mind that, father," said Thumbling; "if my
    mother will only harness the horse, I will get into his ear,
    and tell him which way to go." "Well," said the father, "we
    will try for once."</p>

    <p>When the time came, the mother harnessed the horse to the
    cart, and put Thumbling into its ear; and as he sat there, the
    little man told the beast how to go, crying out, "Go on," and
    "Stop," as he wanted; so the horse went on just as if the
    woodman had driven it himself into the wood. It happened that,
    as the horse was going a little too fast, and Thumbling was
    calling out "Gently, gently!" two strangers came up. "What an
    odd thing that is!" said one, "there is a cart going along, and
    I heard a carter talking to the horse but can see no one."
    "That is strange," said the other; "let us follow the cart and
    see where it goes." So they went on into the wood, till at last
    they came to the place where the woodman was. Then Thumbling,
    seeing his father, cried out, "See, father, here I am, with the
    cart, all right and safe; now take me down." So his father took
    hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his
    son out of the ear; then he put him down upon a straw, where he
    sat as merry as you please. The two strangers were all this
    time looking on, and did not know what to say for wonder. At
    last one took the other aside and said, "That little urchin
    will make our fortune if we can get him, and carry him about
    from town to town as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"
       id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span> a show; we must buy him."
       So they went to the woodman and asked him what he would take
       for the little man: "He will be better off," said they,
       "with us than with you." "I won't sell him at all," said the
       father, "my own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the
       silver and gold in the world." But Thumbling, hearing of the
       bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father's coat to
       his shoulder, and whispered in his ear, "Take the money,
       father, and let them have me; I'll soon come back to
       you."</p>

    <p>So the woodman at last agreed to sell Thumbling to the
    strangers for a large piece of gold. "Where do you like to
    sit?" said one of them. "Oh! put me on the rim of your hat,
    that will be a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there, and
    see the country as we <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"
       id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span> go along." So they did as
       he wished; and when Thumbling had taken leave of his father,
       they carried him away with them. They journeyed on till it
       began to be dusky, and then the little man said, "Let me get
       down, I'm tired." So the man took off his hat and set him
       down on a clod of earth in a ploughed field by the side of
       the road, But Thumbling ran about amongst the furrows, and
       at last slipped into a mouse-hole. "Good-night, masters,"
       said he, "I'm off! mind and look sharp after me the next
       time." They ran directly to the place, and poked the ends of
       their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain; Thumbling
       only crawled further and further in, and at last it became
       quite dark, so they were obliged to go their way without
       their prize, as sulky as you please.</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <img width="500"

    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"
       id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>

    <p>When Thumbling found they were gone, he came out of his
    hiding-place. "What dangerous walking it is," said he, "in this
    ploughed field! If I were to fall from one of these great
    clods, I should certainly break my neck." At last, by good
    chance, he found a large empty snail-shell. "This is lucky,"
    said he, "I can sleep here very well," and in he crept. Just as
    he was falling asleep he heard two men passing, and one said to
    the other, "How shall we manage to steal that rich parson's
    silver and gold?" "I'll tell you," cried Thumbling. "What noise
    was that?" said the thief, frightened. "I am sure I heard some
    one speak." They stood still listening, and Thumbling said,
    "Take me with you, and I'll soon show you how to get the
    parson's money." "But where are you?" said they. "Look about on
    the ground," answered he, "and listen where the sound comes
    from." At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him up in
    their hands. "You little urchin!" said they, "what can you do
    for us?" "Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the
    parson's house, and throw you out whatever you want." "That's a
    good thought," said the thieves: "come along, we shall see what
    you can do."</p>

    <p>When they came to the parson's house, Thumbling slipped
    through the window-bars into the room, and then called out as
    loudly as he could bawl, "Will you have all that is here?" At
    this the thieves were frightened, and said "Softly, softly,
    speak low that you may not awaken anybody." But Thumbling
    pretended not to understand them, and bawled out again, "How
    much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?" Now the cook lay
    in the next room, and hearing a noise she raised herself in her
    bed and listened. Meanwhile the thieves were frightened, and
    ran off to a little distance; but at last they plucked up
    courage, and said, "The little urchin is only trying to make
    fools of us." So they came back and whispered softly to him,
    saying, "Now, let us have no more of your jokes, but throw out
    some of the money." Then Thumbling called out as loudly as he
    could, "Very well; hold out your hands, here it comes." The
    cook heard this quite plainly, so she sprang out of bed and ran
    to open the door. The thieves rushed off as if a wolf were at
    their heels; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"
       id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span> and the maid, having groped
       about and found nothing, went away for a light. By the time
       she returned, Thumbling had slipped off into the barn; and
       when the cook had looked about and searched every hole and
       corner, and found nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must
       have been dreaming with her eyes open. The little man
       crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a glorious
       place to finish his night's rest in; so he laid himself
       down, meaning to sleep till daylight, and then find his way
       home to his father and mother. But, alas! how cruelly was he
       disappointed! what crosses and sorrows happen in this world!
       The cook got up early, before daybreak, to feed the cows:
       she went straight to the hay loft, and carried away a large
       bundle of hay with the little man in the middle of it fast
       asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not wake till
       he found himself in the mouth of the cow, who had taken him
       up with a mouthful of hay: "Good lack-a-day!" said he, "how
       did I manage to tumble into the mill?" But he soon found out
       where he really was, and was obliged to have all his wits
       about him in order that he might not get <!--blank page-->
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
       id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> between the cow's teeth,
       and so be crushed to death. At last she swallowed him down.
       "It is rather dark here," said he; "they forgot to build
       windows in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no
       bad thing."</p>

             alt="Thumbling getting small" />
    </div>

    <p>Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his
    quarters at all; and the worst of it was, that more and more
    hay was always coming down, and the space in which he was
    became smaller and smaller. At last he cried out as loudly as
    he could, "Don't bring me any more hay! Don't bring me any more
    hay!" The maid happened to be just then milking the cow, and
    hearing someone speak and seeing nobody, and yet being quite
    sure it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she
    was so much frightened that she fell off her stool and overset
    the milk-pail. She ran off as fast as she could to her master,
    the parson, and said, "Sir, sir, the cow is talking!" But the
    parson said, "Woman, thou art surely mad!" However, he went
    with her into the cow-house to see what was the matter.
    Scarcely had they set their feet on the threshold when
    Thumbling called out, "Don't bring me any more hay!" Then the
    parson himself was frightened; and thinking the cow was surely
    bewitched, ordered that she should be killed directly. So the
    cow was killed, and the part in which Thumbling lay was thrown
    away.</p>

    <p>Thumbling soon set himself to work to get out, which was not
    a very easy task; but at last, just as he had made room to get
    his head through, a new misfortune befell him: a hungry wolf
    passed by and swallowed Thumbling and all, at a single gulp,
    and ran away. Thumbling, however, was not disheartened; and
    thinking the wolf would not dislike having some chat with him
    as he was going along, he called out, "My good friend, I can
    show you a famous treat." "Where's that?" said the wolf. "In
    such and such a house," said Thumbling, describing his father's
    house, "you can crawl through the drain into the kitchen, and
    there you will find cakes, ham, beef, and everything your heart
    can desire." The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that
    very night he went to the house and crawled through the drain
    into the kitchen, and ate and drank there
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"
       id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span> to his heart's content. As
       soon as he was satisfied, he wanted to get away; but he had
       eaten so much that he could not get out the same way that he
       came in. This was just what Thumbling had reckoned upon; and
       he now began to set up a great shout, making all the noise
       he could. "Will you be quiet?" said the wolf, "you'll awaken
       everybody in the house." "What's that to me?" said the
       little man, "you have had your frolic, now I've a mind to be
       merry myself;" and he began again singing and shouting as
       loudly as he could.</p>

        NOISE,<br />
         PEEPED THROUGH A CRACK IN THE DOOR."
    </div>

    <p>The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise,
    peeped through a crack in the door; but when they saw that the
    wolf was there, you may well suppose that they were terribly
    frightened; and the woodman ran for his axe, and gave his wife
    a scythe. "Now do you stay behind," said the woodman; "and when
    I have knocked him on the head, do you cut him open with the
    scythe." Thumbling heard all this, and said, "Father, father! I
    am here; the wolf has swallowed me;" and his father said,
    "Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again;" and he
    told his wife not to use the scythe, for fear she should hurt
    him. Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on the
    head, and killed him on the spot; and when he was dead they cut
    open his body and set Thumbling free. "Ah!" said the father,
    "what fears we have had for you!" "Yes, father," answered he,
    "I have travelled all over the world, since we parted, in one
    way or other; and now I am very glad to get fresh air again."
    "Why, where have you been?" said the father. "I have been in a
    mouse-hole, in a snail-shell, down a cow's throat, and inside
    the wolf; and yet here I am again safe and sound." "Well," said
    they, "we will not sell you again for all the riches in the
    world." So they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and
    gave him plenty to eat and drink, and fetched new clothes for
    him, for his old ones were quite spoiled on his
    journey.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
